 * unlocked and banked, and what the player has chosen to bring into the NEXT run. It only
 * ever influences a run by choosing that run's EngineConfig (skinId + loadout); it never
 * feeds the sim mid-match, so it cannot break determinism or replay.
 *
 * Everything here is plain serializable data (persisted via meta/store). The forge
 * transactions that evolve it are pure functions in meta/forge.
