/**
 * Forge transactions (design/14) — pure functions over MetaState. Each returns a NEW

 * per design/14: UNLOCK a blueprint (permanent account right) and CRAFT an instance from
 * an unlocked blueprint by spending banked materials, staging it into the next run's
 * loadout (≤ WEAPON_SLOTS; each crafted weapon lasts exactly one run, design/05).
 *
 * Crafting currency is the five elemental materials (content/materials.ts), banked per
 * (element, ROLLED tier) via `bankKey` — so a recipe's `minTier` is ENFORCED: a cost of
 * `fire ×3 minTier 2` is only satisfied by fire materials rolled at tier ≥ 2 (deeper
 * floors, ROADMAP 1.5). A cost with no `minTier` accepts any tier (≥ 0). Spending draws
 * from the LOWEST qualifying tier first (deterministic), so a player's scarce high-tier
 * materials are preserved for the recipes that actually require them.

 * blueprints a fresh account starts unlocked (`repeater` + `scattergun`, both guns) could
 * be staged together into a run with no melee weapon at all: no parry, and a swap button
 * toggling between two of the same thing — the exact state `ENGINE_VERSION` 46's
 * same-kind pickup rule was written to prevent a floor weapon from producing. The forge is
 * the only place a same-kind pair can enter a normal run, so it is the right place for the
