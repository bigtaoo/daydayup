/**
 * The catalogue's own drift gate.
 *
 * `audioAssets.test.ts` already checks the shipped files against `credits.json` and the cue
 * union. What it cannot see is the third party that has to agree with both: the catalogue the
 * RUNTIME reads. A cue whose `variants` count is one too low ships a file nothing ever plays;
 * one too high asks for a path that 404s, and `SampleBank` swallows that by design (a failed
 * file falls back to the synth voice) — so the symptom of a wrong number here is not an error
 * anywhere, it is a variant quietly missing from the mix. Hence: generated paths are checked
 * against the directory listing in both directions.
 *
 * The mix values (gain/priority) are checked only for the properties design/11 actually
 * states. Whether 0.8 is the right gain for `muzzle` is a taste question no test can hold —
 * see `art/audio/README.md` on what measurement can and cannot say about this set.
