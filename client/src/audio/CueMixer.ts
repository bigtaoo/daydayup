// How a cue becomes sound (design/11): the shipped sample if one is loaded, the synth voice
// if not, under the catalogue's mix and the voice cap.
//
// Both platform backends compose this, so the decision ladder exists ONCE:
//
//   1. `SampleBank` has a decoded variant → play it, at the catalogue's gain, with a small
//      render-side pitch jitter, counted against `VoiceBudget`.
//   2. It does not (a synth-only cue, still loading at boot, or every file failed) →
//      `audioSynth.playCue`, exactly what shipped before the asset pass.
//
// Step 2 is not a temporary shim. `status.burn` has no sample by decision, and a cue's first
// firings on a cold boot land before the preload resolves — an audible-but-different voice
// beats silence, and both paths pass through the same gain so the swap does not change the
// weight of the mix.
//
// DETERMINISM (design/06/11). Everything here runs on the render clock and reads nothing but
// the cue id. The variant choice and pitch jitter draw from an injected `random` that
// defaults to `Math.random` — NEVER the sim's `Prng`, whose stream a sound must not perturb.
