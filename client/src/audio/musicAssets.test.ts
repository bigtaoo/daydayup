/**
 * The shipped music loops' own rules, read from the SHIPPED files under
 * `public/audio/music/` and the provenance record in `art/audio/credits.json`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE HAD TO EXIST. Until it did, the two loops were outside every TypeScript-side
 * gate in the repo — and not because anyone decided that. `platform/audioAssets.test.ts` reads
 * `public/audio/` with a NON-recursive `readdirSync`, so the moment music shipped into a
 * subdirectory it fell out of that file's byte budget, its credits cross-check, its format check
 * and its licence sweep, silently and all at once. 1.09 MB of assets with no gate is exactly the
 * situation that file was written to end for the cues.
 *
 * It is not a copy of that file. Music's rules are inverted or absent in three places, and each
 * inversion is a real decision worth pinning:
 *
 *  - **Stereo is REQUIRED here, and forbidden there.** A 100 ms cue's second channel is pure
 *    overhead; a 69 s bed streams, so its bytes amortise. A mono re-encode of a music loop would
 *    pass the cue gate and be a downgrade.
 *  - **The LENGTH is load-bearing, not descriptive.** `MusicPlayer` starts the next deck at
 *    `length - XFADE_S` because the loop is closed by the player, not the file. A catalogue
 *    length that drifts from the shipped file puts the crossfade in the wrong place, which is
 *    audible as a badly cut loop and invisible everywhere else.
 *  - **The licence is NOT CC0.** These are AI-generated masters, so they cannot go through
 *    `packs.json` (whose every entry that file asserts is CC0). The provenance lives in
 *    `credits.json`'s own `music`/`music_terms` block, and what this file checks is that the
 *    record exists and stays HONEST about what it does not have — an unarchived licence text and
 *    an uncaptured prompt are recorded gaps, and a test that demanded they be filled would only
 *    invite them to be filled with a guess.
 *
 * Nothing here decodes audio; the mp3s are parsed at the MPEG frame level (`audio/mp3Frames.ts`,
 * shared with the cue gate). Whether a loop sounds RIGHT is not testable and is not tested — see
 * `art/audio/README.md` on what measurement can and cannot say about these two files.

 *
 * Deliberately NOT generous. Music is by far the heaviest asset class in the game — the two
 * loops together outweigh all 50 cues by 11x — so the one thing this number has to do is make a
 * re-encode at a higher bitrate an explicit decision rather than a silent 40% increase.
