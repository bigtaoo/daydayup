// The music catalogue (design/11 "Music & ambience") — the data half of "what does a track
// sound like, and where does its file live". Same shape and same reasoning as
// `cueCatalogue.ts`: the union lives in `platform/types.ts`, the exhaustive `Record` lives
// here, so a track cannot reach the player without a music decision existing for it.
//
// WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM A CUE, and it is most of the file:
//
//  - **A track is STREAMED, never decoded into a `SampleBank`.** A 69 s stereo loop decodes
//    to ~26 MB of `AudioBuffer` at 48 kHz. That single figure is why music runs on two
//    long-lived decks (an `Audio` element on web, an `InnerAudioContext` on WeChat) instead of
//    going through the path all 50 cues share.
//  - **Length is part of the decision, not a curiosity.** The loop is closed by the PLAYER,
//    not by the file: `el.loop = true` is unusable because MP3 frame padding denies
//    sample-exact wrapping, so `MusicPlayer` starts a second deck at `length - XFADE_S` and
//    equal-power crossfades into it. It therefore has to KNOW the length, and the number here
//    is checked against the shipped file's real audible duration by `musicAssets.test.ts` — a
//    length that drifts from the file would put the wrap in the wrong place, which is audible
//    as a stumble rather than as an error.
//  - **A track may be a PLACEHOLDER**, and that is a field rather than a comment. See
//    `borrowedFrom`.
//
// The level decision is NOT here. It lives in the asset: every shipped loop is normalised so
// its 250-2000 Hz RMS lands at -30 dBFS (`tools/audio-pipeline/process_music.py`'s
// `MID_TARGET_DBFS`, gated by `audit.py --class music`), which leaves every cue's peak 9-16 dB
// above the bed in the band they share. `gain` below is a mix knob on top of that and every
// shipped value is 1.0 — the same discipline `CueDef.gain` records, for the same reason: two
// places to set a level is one place too many for anyone to find the level later.
