// The cue catalogue (design/11 "Cue catalogue") — the data half of "what does a cue sound
// like", and the file design/11 named as the one thing blocking the then-46 shipped mp3s from
// ever being audible.
//
// WHY IT LIVES HERE, not in the design/12 asset manifest. `render/assetPacks.json` answers
// a different question ("which WeChat package does this path belong to") and it answers it
// for audio already, by prefix rule, with no entry needed. What it cannot hold is the mix:
// per-cue gain, the voice-cap priority, and how many variants exist. Those are content
// decisions in design/09's sense — data, never inline code — so they get a content-shaped
// table, and the loader (SampleBank) derives paths from it.
//
// WHY VARIANT COUNTS RATHER THAN FILE LISTS. The shipped set is named mechanically by
// `tools/audio-pipeline/` (`<stem>_NN.mp3`, stem = the cue id with '.' → '-'), so a literal
// list of 46 strings would be 46 chances to typo a name that fails silently as "no sample,
// use the synth". `variantPaths` generates them instead, and `cueCatalogue.test.ts` checks
// the generated set against BOTH the files on disk and `art/audio/credits.json` — so a
// renamed, added or dropped asset fails a test rather than going quiet.
//
// A cue with `variants: 0` is a deliberate synth keep, not an omission: `status.burn` has
// no sample because no fire crackle exists in any of the six CC0 packs (see
// `credits.json`'s `kept_on_synth`), and its synth voice is already the right shape.
