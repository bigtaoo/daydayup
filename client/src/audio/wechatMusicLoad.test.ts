/**
 * The WeChat music path, driven end to end against a WeChat-SHAPED runtime, with the paths it
 * produces checked against the REAL shipped files on disk.
 *
 * The music counterpart of `wechatAudioLoad.test.ts`, and it exists for a sharper version of that
 * file's reason. A cue that fails to load on this target is inaudible but harmless — the
 * procedural voice plays instead. Music has no fallback at all: every WeChat-specific difference
 * below is a way to ship 1.09 MB of dead weight and hear nothing, with no error anywhere.
 *
 *   - **The src is a SUBPACKAGE path.** `/audio/music/menu.mp3` really lives at
 *     `packs/music/audio/music/menu.mp3` (`render/assetPacks.json`'s `music` pack, which the byte
 *     gate forced into existence a day before the runtime did). A deck handed the public path
 *     names nothing.
 *   - **There is no audio graph, so there is no bus node.** The settings volume has to be
 *     multiplied into each stream's own `.volume` together with its crossfade level — the one
 *     method whose two platform implementations can never be shared.
 *   - **Music must NOT depend on `createWebAudioContext`**, which is the API design/11 records as
 *     unverified on the lowest base library. If it did, the platform's least certain audio call
 *     would be able to take the bed down with the samples.
 *   - **There is no autoplay gate on this path**, so the bed starts on the first frame rather than
 *     on the first tap — the opposite of both the web music path and this platform's own cues.
 *   - **Interruption arrives as `wx.onAudioInterruptionBegin`**, not `visibilitychange`. There is
 *     no DOM here, so it is the only signal there is.
 *
 * What it CANNOT pin, and still needs a device (design/04's checklist): that a real base library
 * has `createInnerAudioContext` at all, that it accepts a path inside a loaded subpackage, that
 * its decoder takes these two 24 kHz stereo files, and anything about how `currentTime` behaves
 * across a real interruption. A strong regression net, not a substitute for running it.
