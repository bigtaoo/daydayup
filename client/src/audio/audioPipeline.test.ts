/**
 * The whole audio path, end to end, from a `GameEvent` to a buffer source: real
 * `EventReactor` → real `WebAudio` → real `CueMixer`/`SampleBank`/`VoiceBudget`/catalogue.
 * The only fakes are the ones that cannot exist under plain-node vitest — the `AudioContext`
 * and the asset host's byte read.
 *
 * Why this file exists on top of the per-unit tests. Every link here is already covered
 * individually, and that is exactly the problem: the failure this pass was built to end is
 * *silent*. Delete the preload call, drift a catalogue path, break the sample branch, and the
 * game keeps making noise — the synth voices carry it — while the shipped files quietly
 * stop being used. No unit test fails, and nobody hears the difference without knowing what
 * to listen for. This file asserts the property no unit owns: **that a real frame of engine
 * events reaches the SHIPPED samples and not the fallback.** It is the automated form of the
 * browser measurement recorded in design/11's status block (27 sample voices, 0 synth).
