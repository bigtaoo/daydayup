/**
 * Which shipped textures survive a WebGL1 context, and which quietly do not.
 *
 * design/04's verification checklist item 4 ("Verify WebGL2 availability; define a fallback
 * path if unavailable") has always been phrased as a device question. It is not only that:
 * Pixi already HAS the fallback, it just applies it silently, and what it costs depends
 * entirely on the shipped art's dimensions. Two rules in
 * pixi.js/lib/rendering/renderers/gl/texture/GlTextureSystem.mjs:
 *
 *   - line 148: `autoGenerateMipmaps && (context.supports.nonPowOf2mipmaps || isPowerOfTwo)`
 *   - line 180: `forceClamp = !context.supports.nonPowOf2wrapping && !isPowerOfTwo`
 *
 * and GlContextSystem.mjs:228 sets BOTH `nonPowOf2*` flags to `isWebGl2`. So on a WebGL1
 * device every non-power-of-two texture silently loses the mip chain it asked for, and every
 * non-power-of-two texture that asked to WRAP is clamped instead.
 *
 * Neither failure throws, logs, or shows up in any existing test. The first one reproduces
 * the 2026-08-12 "can't tell what this character is" colour-noise bug (design/12); the second
 * turns a tiling swatch into one tile plus a smear of its last column.
 *
 * This file pins the wrapping half, which is small, stable, and where a regression would be
 * most visible. The mipmap half is deliberately NOT pinned by a count — essentially all sprite
 * art is non-power-of-two today and making it otherwise means padding every file and moving
 * every anchor with it, which is an art pass, not a test. It is written down in design/04
 * instead.
