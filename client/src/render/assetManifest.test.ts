/**
 * The pack table's own rules, read from the SHIPPED `assetPacks.json` rather than a fixture.
 *
 * A fixture would defeat the point: what can actually go wrong here is a rule that stops
 * matching a real shipped path (a renamed texture), a rule naming a pack that does not exist,
 * or a deferral that is wrong about the content — none of which a hand-written table would
 * ever reproduce. `build/wechatAssetSync.mjs` reimplements `packOf` in plain Node for the
 * build and the byte gate, so the two are checked against each other at the bottom.
