// does its path look like once it is there. The DATA lives in `assetPacks.json` — see that
// file's own $comment for why it is JSON rather than TypeScript (plain Node reads the same
// table for the byte-budget gate and the WeChat copy step, so the two cannot drift).
//
// Web never needs any of this: its assets are served from the site root and `AssetHost`'s
// web implementation is the identity function. It exists for WeChat, where a subpackage's
// files sit under that subpackage's `root` and are unreachable until `wx.loadSubpackage`
// has run — see `packLoader.ts` for when that happens.
