// Sphere shading (2026-08-18 depth pass, user report *"希望能再强化一下立体效果"*). The eye
// now slides and the modules now orbit, but nothing in the assembled character said its
// SHELL was a sphere rather than a disc — the art is flat-cel by design (design/13) and the
// only lighting in the scene was `NormalLitFilter`'s luminance-derived relief, which
// sharpens edges without ever establishing a form.
//
// **Rebuilt 2026-08-19 after measuring the first version in a real frame** (an A/B extract
// of the shipped hero at 11x, `shade_on`/`shade_off`). It was three marks: a white specular
// toward the key light, four concentric dark ARCS as a terminator, and a faint
// full-perimeter rim ring. Measured, all three were wrong:
//
//   1. **The specular contributed exactly nothing.** design/13's shells are near-white
//      flat-cel art — the lit cap of the hero's shell reads 255 before any shading — and a
//      0.34-alpha WHITE ellipse over white is a no-op. Value can only travel one direction
//      on white art, so the light side has to be expressed as a HUE shift (a warm wash),
//      not as a value lift. The wash also does real work on the dark, re-tinted enemy
//      bodies the same code shades, where the old white blob was merely a pale spot.
//   2. **The terminator read as a smudge, not as a curve.** Four arcs at radii 0.58-0.91
//      put the darkest band right ON the rim, with visibly hard angular cut-offs at each
//      arc's ends, so the lower-right of the shell looked dirty rather than turned-away.
//      Replaced by a full linear ramp across the body (see `drawSphereShading`), which has
//      no ends to cut off, plus a REFLECTED-LIGHT rollback that keeps the outermost sliver
//      brighter than the shadow core — the single change that most restores the crisp
//      flat-cel silhouette design/13 asks for.
//   3. **The rim ring greyed the silhouette.** A faint dark circle just inside the edge, all
//      the way round, is indistinguishable from a muddy outline at play scale. Deleted; the
//      ramp already darkens the turning-away edge, which is the only place it belonged.
//
// **Rebuilt again 2026-08-24, this time as a sampled FIELD rather than as geometry** — the
// third draw-call pass. Every mark above is a function of one normalised position on the body,
// so the whole overlay is a 2-D image, and `sphereShadeField` bakes it once into a shared
// texture that every rig in the game samples from one quad.
//
// The version this replaced was 40 non-overlapping chord bands plus 3 nested ellipses: 55 fills
// and 710 floats of geometry per rig instance, which is over Pixi v8's 400-float auto-batch line
// (`render/staticGraphics.ts`), so every actor on screen cost a draw call and a program switch
// each way — 20 of the level-1 start room's 107, at 8 live enemies, and it scaled with the enemy
// count where a level-1 room holds 15-30. One quad is 8 floats, and the texture is normalised by
// radius, so it is ONE bake for every skin and every body size rather than one per (skin, radius).
//
// The band form existed because the obvious tool did not work: Pixi 8's `FillGradient` calls
// `DOMAdapter.createCanvas()` at `fill()` time, which throws in this repo's canvas-free test
// environment, and reading the retained Graphics instruction list was how this look was
// machine-checked. `render/shadeRamp.ts` gets the same smoothness from a `BufferImageSource`,
// which needs no canvas — so the field is testable by SAMPLING it, which is a stronger check
// than counting bands was. See that module's header.
//
// Two things the bands got right and this keeps. Each band's alpha WAS its ramp value (they never
// overlapped), so the steps could not compound into the opacity banding that stacked translucent
// arcs showed on the pillars — a texel is the same guarantee, made exact. And containment: a band
// was chord-limited so every corner provably sat inside the body circle, because nothing here is
// masked and a mark outside the art paints on transparent background. The field does it by
// construction — it is zero outside `dist > 1` — which is why the old `chordBand` helper and its
// containment proof are gone rather than ported.

 *  **The radius has to be the drawn one, and until 2026-08-19 it was not.** `RigSkin` passed the

 *  Measuring the shipped PNGs' alpha bounding boxes (`skinRegistry.BODY_FILL`) showed they paint
