/**
 * `rigShading` — the depth-cue marks a rig draws on top of its own flat-cel art (2026-08-18,
 * user report *"希望能再强化一下立体效果"*). Split out of RigSkin.ts; `RigSkin.test.ts` covers
 * how they are wired into the rig, this file covers the geometry and colour maths.
 *
 * **Rewritten 2026-08-19** with the marks themselves (see `rigShading.ts`'s header for the
 * measured A/B that replaced a white specular + four dark arcs + a rim ring with a warm wash,
 * a smooth chord-band ramp and an underside occlusion). The properties worth machine-checking
 * are the ones a hand-tuned constant can silently break:
 *
 *   - every mark stays strictly INSIDE the body radius (nothing may spill onto the transparent
 *     background — which is what lets this work with no mask at all);
 *   - the light has ONE direction, and the warm side and the dark side oppose it;
 *   - the ramp is monotonic and its steps are small enough to be invisible;
 *   - the reflected-light rollback exists, i.e. the darkest point is NOT the outermost one. That
 *     is the difference between a body that reads as round and one that reads as smudged, and
 *     it is a single constant away from silently disappearing.
 *
 * **Re-pointed 2026-08-24** at the FIELD rather than at the geometry. The overlay used to be 40
 * chord bands and 3 ellipses, so every property above was asserted by reading the bands back off
 * `context.instructions` and comparing neighbours; it is now one quad sampling a baked texture
 * (`sphereShadeField`), so the same properties are asserted by SAMPLING — which is strictly more
 * direct, since a band comparison could only ever see band centres. Two of them get sharper as a
 * result: "steps too small to see" is now a bound on the texel-to-texel step of the shipped
 * texture, and "inside the body radius" is checked over every texel rather than over band corners.
 * The perf claim the rewrite was for has its own test at the bottom of the sphere section.
