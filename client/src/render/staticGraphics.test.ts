/**
 * `staticGraphics` — and, more importantly, the Pixi v8 rule it exists to override.
 *
 * The factory itself is one line, so a test that only checked `batchMode === 'batch'` would be
 * restating the implementation. What actually needs pinning is the *premise*: that Pixi auto-batches
 * a `Graphics` only below 400 floats of geometry, that the comparison is strict, and that `'batch'`
 * overrides it however large the geometry gets. Every doc comment in this module, `scene/layers.ts`'s
 * render-group split, `perf/drawAttribution.ts`'s `AUTO_BATCH_VERTEX_LIMIT` and the whole 2026-08-24
 * draw-call pass rest on that rule holding — and it lives in Pixi, where a version bump can move it
 * without any of our types noticing.
 *
 * So the rule is exercised against the REAL `GraphicsContextSystem`, driven by the smallest fake
 * renderer it will accept (it wants only a uid, a texture limit and a GC hash registry).
