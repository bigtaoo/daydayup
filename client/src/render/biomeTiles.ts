// "other biomes' looks" — the room ground/walls were code-only palette tints until
// now, see game/config.ts's biomePalette()). Same non-blocking best-effort preload
// pattern as uiSkins.ts/weaponSkins.ts: a missing/not-yet-generated swatch just leaves
// RoomBuilder on its existing flat-colour fallback, never blocks boot.
//
// Keyed by BiomeElement (game/config.ts), not by DungeonConfig.biomeId — a biome's
// LOOK is one swatch per element, reused by every biome that shares that element
// (mirrors how biomePalette() already works). 'poison' has no swatch yet (design/13:
// poison isn't floor 1 and has no dedicated critter either) — RoomBuilder's fallback
// covers it until one is generated.
