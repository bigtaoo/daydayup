// design/12's asset-loading phases, as the functions both entries call.
//
// This used to be one `preloadCoreArt()` — every pack and every loader, awaited before the
// game was constructed. That satisfied WeChat's 4 MB first-download rule (the packs existed)
// while buying nothing from it (all their bytes still arrived before the first frame), and it
// held the main package at 99.93% full, where the next code change of any size failed the byte
// gate. Since 2026-09-01 it is two phases — see design/12, "the first download is code only":
//
//   LOBBY  `preloadLobbyArt()`  the `lobby` pack + the UI loader. Awaited by both entries
//                               before `new Game(...)`, behind `ui/loadingScreen.ts`.
//   RUN    `ensureRunArt()`     every `run`-phase pack + the four remaining loaders. Kicked in
//                               the background from the lobby by `beginDeferredArt()`, and
//                               awaited at the run boundary by `game/controllers/ArtGate.ts`.
//
// THE RULE THIS SHAPE EXISTS TO KEEP (design/12): the set of available textures changes only at
// a phase boundary. Not per asset, not per room. Re-running a loader once its pack has landed
// is safe and nearly free — the four sprite loaders are idempotent map-fillers over a static path
// table with a per-item try/catch, and Pixi's `Assets` memoises by URL — but a texture that
// appears halfway through a room does not fix the sprite that was built without it, and that is
// the class of bug this repo has the worst record with. (`preloadRigSkin` is the exception to the
// "free" half: it re-reads its two JSON sidecars rather than skipping a bundle it already holds,
// which is why it belongs to the run phase and is never called in the lobby one.)
//
// Every load is best-effort and per-item: a failed or slow asset leaves that consumer on its
// Graphics fallback and boot continues ("gameplay is never blocked on art", design/02/12).
// That is a stronger requirement on WeChat than on web, not a weaker one — a mini-game has no
// reload button.
