/**
 * Muzzle parity (design/18 G6, Layer 2) — the bullet's birth position is authored TWICE and
 * nothing cross-checks the two tables:
 *
 *   SIM    `muzzleGrid` per weapon (`engine/content/weaponSpecs/*.ts`) → `RangedSimSpec
 *          .muzzleOffset` → `WeaponFireSystem.spawnBullet` spawns at `actor + muzzleOffset`
 *          along the aim ray, on the GROUND plane.
 *   RENDER `anchor` / `rotationOffsetRad` / `scale` per weapon (`render/weaponSkins.ts`) →
 *          `rigWeaponMount.barrelReach`/`moduleMuzzleLocal` → `RigSkin.muzzleLocal()` →
 *          `Actor.muzzlePos()` → `Scene` → `Bullet.setMuzzleOrigin`.
 *
 * Nothing errors when they disagree: `Bullet.setMuzzleOrigin` EASES the difference away over
 * the first `MUZZLE_EASE_DISTANCE_PX` of flight, so a mismatch is silently converted into a
 * bigger correction. That is exactly why this is a test and not a look — the failure mode is
 * "the shot bends out of the gun", which no assertion anywhere was making.
 *
 * ## The geometry this file measures
 *
 * Everything is evaluated at aim = 0 (due east), the one pose where the whole chain is a
 * single scalar reach along the aim ray, and where the sim's own `muzzleOffset` is by
 * definition that same scalar. In that pose:
 *
 *   render reach (world px) = ( mount.x + barrelReach(tex, anchor, rotationOffsetRad) × scale )
 *                             × (actor radius px / rig referenceRadius)
 *
 * `mount.x` is `activeModuleMount`'s own answer — the socket bone's FK tip for the hero's
 * orb-core ('socket'), the body's measured drawn edge for a mob ('held') — and the trailing
 * factor is `Skin`'s authoring-px → gameplay-radius wrapper scale. All three are called here
 * as the shipped functions rather than restated, so a retune of any of them moves this table.
 *
 * ## The per-weapon table, measured 2026-08-30 (gap = render − sim, world px)

 *   enemygun       floater-core@13px     20.00       23.45    +3.45
 *   enemygun       brute-core@20px       20.00       36.11   +16.11
 *
 * `gyre` is the one NEGATIVE row and it is deliberate: `muzzleGrid 1.6` spawns its projectile
 * out on the orbit circle (weaponSpecs' own comment), so the sim muzzle is meant to sit past
 * the barrel. `enemygun`'s spread is the mob bodies, not the gun — the same weapon on a
 * 20 px brute reaches 13 px further than on a 15 px critter, since the rig scales whole.
 *
 * The +12..14 px cluster is the same offset `Bullet.ts`' own doc records as "measured on real
 * shots", which is the cheapest available check that this model of the chain is the real one.
 *
 * ## Why the bound is `ease / 2` and not `ease`
 *
 * Derived, not chosen (and `derivedEaseDistancePx()` below measures the ease budget off the
 * shipped `Bullet` rather than restating the un-exported 40): the drawn position is
 * `base + gap·k²` with `k = remaining/ease`, so at the moment of the shot the correction
 * drains at `2·gap/ease` px per px flown. Above `gap = ease/2` that exceeds the bullet's own
 * forward motion and the drawn round moves BACKWARDS out of the barrel. `it('a gap of
 * ease/2 is exactly …')` proves that on a real Bullet instead of trusting this paragraph.
 *
 * `novaburst` is over it (25.81 px) and is a DECLARED EXCEPTION rather than a loosened bound:
 * its `muzzleGrid` is 0.5 where the rest of the ranged catalog is 0.9375, i.e. its sim muzzle
 * is half the roster's while its art reaches as far as any of them. Nothing about the frame
 * (a burst emitter) explains the halved offset, so this is recorded as a real content
 * disagreement with a ceiling on it, not as a rule.
 *
 * ## Mutation battery
 *
 * Run 2026-08-30 against this file only (`npx vitest run src/render/muzzleParity.test.ts`),
 * every mutation reverted afterwards and confirmed clean with `git diff --stat`.
 *
 *   KILLED   novaburst muzzleGrid 0.5 -> 0.9375 ...... 1 test: the declared-exception guard
 *   KILLED   cannon muzzleGrid 1.0 -> 2.0 ............ 1: the smooth-departure bound
 *   KILLED   ORB_CORE_RIG socket_r len 52 -> 80 ...... 1: novaburst's exception ceiling
 *   KILLED   HELD_MOUNT_R 1.0 -> 1.6 ................. 1: the smooth bound, via enemygun
 *   KILLED   MUZZLE_EASE_DISTANCE_PX 40 -> 24 ........ 1: the HARD bound (gap >= a full ease)
 *   KILLED   scattergun rotationOffsetRad dropped .... 1: the barrel-direction check
 *   KILLED   blaster anchor.x 0.22 -> 0.72 ........... 2: barrel direction + the smooth bound
 *   KILLED   blaster render scale 80/160 -> 130/160 .. 1: the smooth bound
 *   KILLED   WEAPON_DEFS.gyre entry deleted .......... 2: coverage + the def-count guard
 *   SURVIVED blaster render scale 80/160 -> 110/160
 *   SURVIVED MODULE_SCALE 0.75 -> 0.6
 *
 * Each kill was checked to be the test whose NAME describes that mutation, not merely some
 * red. The two survivors are the same honest gap, recorded rather than papered over: this
 * file bounds the sim/render DISAGREEMENT, so a render-side rescale is invisible to it until
 * the gap actually leaves the budget. blaster at 110/160 is still 16.6 px out (it dies at
 * ~125/160), and `MODULE_SCALE` 0.6 moves every muzzle INWARD, toward the sim point, which
 * shrinks every gap in the table. How big a module may be in the first place is a different
 * question, owned by `rigComposition.test.ts`'s module-proportion band — which does kill the
 * per-weapon 110/160 (checked), though not `MODULE_SCALE` itself, since that constant is the
 * deliberate whole-roster proportion knob its own doc says to tune.
