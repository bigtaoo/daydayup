/**
 * The phase functions themselves (design/12, "the first download is code only") — the claims
 * that live in `render/preloadArt.ts` and nowhere else.
 *
 * `wechatPhasedBoot.test.ts` drives the whole two-phase boot against a WeChat-shaped runtime and
 * is the place to assert ORDER — what exists when. It cannot see the things this file is about,
 * because its `beforeAll` performs the two calls that would otherwise be missing: it awaits
 * `ensureRunArt(cb)` itself, so the background kick inside `beginDeferredArt` is doing no work
 * that the test is not also doing by hand, and it registers its listener before the first unit
 * settles, so the progress replay is only ever observed at zero. Both mutants stayed green there.
 *
 * So this file drives the module through a COUNTING `AssetHost` instead, and each case is about
 * one thing that host makes visible:
 *
 *   - `loadPack` calls say whether a download happened at all, and how many times;
 *   - `readJson` calls say whether a LOADER pass happened — the one part of a re-run that is not
 *     free (two sidecars per rig bundle, see this module's header), and therefore the only
 *     evidence that the promise memo is doing its job. `packLoader` memoises packs on its own,
 *     so pack counts alone cannot tell a shared loader pass from a repeated one;
 *   - a blocking `loadPack` freezes the download mid-way, which is the only way to observe a
 *     listener that JOINS a download already in progress.
 *
 * Every asset load underneath fails here (no DOM, no reachable URL) and every loader is
 * best-effort per item by design (design/02/12), so nothing below asserts a texture — the
 * bookkeeping is the subject.
