/**
 * `pinTextMeasurementToPaintCanvas` guards a defect that is invisible to every other test
 * in this repo: Pixi MEASURES text on an `OffscreenCanvas` but PAINTS it on a DOM canvas,
 * and Chrome resolves the CSS generic font families differently between the two, so
 * `Text.width` can come back ~2x the painted width (see textMetrics.ts).
 *
 * Neither canvas kind exists in this Node-only test env, so both are faked — and faked
 * with the ACTUAL advance widths measured in Chrome/Windows on 2026-08-15 for
 * `bold 15px monospace`, which is what makes the second describe block a real regression
 * test rather than a tautology: the "offscreen" fake is ~2x wider for Cyrillic and the
 * "DOM" fake is not, exactly the discrepancy the user's Russian settings screen hit.
 * `document.createElement` is stubbed because that is what Pixi's `BrowserAdapter`
 * (`DOMAdapter.get().createCanvas()`) calls, and `CanvasRenderingContext2D` because
 * Pixi probes its prototype for letter-spacing support on the first measurement.

 * NaN rather than absent, and Pixi's per-line width is
 * `Math.max(metrics.width, actualBoundingBoxRight - -actualBoundingBoxLeft)`. Its `?? 0` guards
 * a MISSING field, not a NaN one, and `Math.max(43.3, NaN)` is NaN.
