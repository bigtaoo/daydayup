// The game-side .tao runtime renderer (design/12): bone FK + sprite binding +
// animation playback, ported from tools/animator/src/rendering/Renderer.ts's
// `updateSprites` (rewritten for Pixi v8's API — the editor is still on v7).
//
// Placement model (fixed 2026-08-17 — the port originally drew every sprite at its
// bone's PIVOT, unrotated-by-nothing, which visibly disassembled the character):
//   - A bone's art is centred on its TIP (`pose.ex/ey`), not its pivot — the tip is
//     where the rig itself puts that bone's `bodyR` body circle (the editor's own
//     skeleton view draws it there), so it's the point the art was sized against. It
//     matters because every rig here hangs its body off a pivot at the actor's feet
//     via one upward body bone (`shell`/`body`/`core`, `len` = hover height): drawing
//     at the pivot put the body a full body-length BELOW its own children, so
//     orb-core's eye/belly/both weapon sockets piled up in one spot above the shell's
//     head instead of sitting on the shell.
//   - Rotation is the bone's angle RELATIVE TO ITS REST ANGLE (`pose.wa - rwa`), so
//     art authored the way it reads on screen (shell upright, belly upright) stays
//     upright, and only animation/aim actually turns it. Drawing at the raw world
//     angle instead rotated every one of these rigs by its body bone's rest angle
//     (-90°, since it points up) — the hero's crystal spikes pointed left, and every
//     critter/boss body was 90° off too.
//
// Facing model (design/12 "Facing model (twin-stick 360° aim)"), extended with an
// upper/lower body split: a 2D bone rig gives L/R flip + part rotation, not a true
// 3D turn.
//   - L/R mirror + front/back hemisphere are driven by the BODY facing (movement
//     direction for a player, same as its aim for anything stationary like an
//     enemy) via `setBodyFacing` — the whole rig flips by that direction's
//     horizontal sign (`view.scale.x`), and aiming toward the top of the screen
//     (dy < 0, away from the camera) swaps in each slot's 'back' variant where one
//     exists (today: only `eye` has one — the concept turnaround's eye/vent swap).
//   - Aim-tracking socket rotation: the ACTIVE socket's WORLD rotation is overridden
//     every frame to the live AIM angle (`setAim`, design/03/12/13 "following that
//     socket's aim rotation every frame") instead of playing only its authored
//     clip — independently of the body flip above, so the gun can point at the
//     shot direction while the legs face movement. The rig is authored assuming it
//     faces right (rest pose `wa`/binding.rotation are canonical, unflipped); when
//     `view.scale.x` mirrors the whole rig, a socket's LOCAL rotation must be the
//     mirror image of the true aim angle so the flip renders it pointing at the
//     real reticle — see `canonicalSocketAngleRad` below.

   * `heightPx` is the HEIGHT half of this point, which `y` alone cannot express: that is two
   * world quantities added — how high off the floor the tip is, and how far north of its
   * carrier it stands — separable only because both mount paths carry the module along the aim
   * ray in the GROUND plane at a fixed height (see GROUND-PLANE ORBIT). `Scene` draws the round
   * at this height rather than at `bulletZ`, since the gap between those is straight up the
   * screen, i.e. PERPENDICULAR to a horizontal shot: an arc. Excludes `view.x/y` (added to the
   * point above) — the recoil's body shove runs along the aim ON THE GROUND, so it is position.
