// Making a subpackage's files reachable before anything asks for them (design/04, design/12).
//
// On WeChat a subpackage's files do not exist until `wx.loadSubpackage` has run for it — a
// texture path inside one resolves to nothing before that, which every loader here would
// treat as "not generated yet" and silently fall back on. So the load has to be ordered
// ahead of the preload, not raced with it.
//
// **Which packs are fetched WHEN is declared in `assetPacks.json`, not here** (design/12,
// "the first download is code only"): each pack carries a `phase`, and `preloadArt.ts` asks
// `packsForPhase()` for the list. Until 2026-09-01 this module's only caller was
// `ensureAllPacks()` from `preloadCoreArt` — every pack at boot, which satisfied WeChat's
// first-download rule while buying nothing else, because the bytes still all arrived before
// the first frame. Now the `lobby` pack is awaited at boot and the rest are kicked from the
// lobby, with the `run`-phase ones awaited again at the run boundary
// (`game/controllers/ArtGate.ts`).
//
// `ensureAllPacks()` survives as the "everything, now" path: `preloadCoreArt` still offers the
// old one-call shape, which is what the loader tests and any caller that does not want to
// think about phases run against.
//
// On web this is all no-ops — there are no subpackages, the files are just served, and
// `AssetHost.loadPack` is absent.
