/**
 * Assembly invariants over every SHIPPED skin bundle — "is the character put together
 * correctly", checked against the real files in `client/public/skins/`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The hero rig rendered visibly disassembled for ~3 weeks (art drawn
 * at each bone's pivot instead of its tip, and rotated by the bone's raw world angle) while
 * 1272 client tests stayed green and a full coverage audit passed. Two reasons the existing
 * tests could not see it, both of which this file is built to avoid:
 *
 *   1. They asserted the ONE number a past bug taught someone to assert — the weapon
 *      socket's aim rotation — and nothing about where any sprite actually SAT.
 *   2. `RigSkin.test.ts`/`Actor.test.ts` run on a FAKE bundle (`Texture.WHITE`, every
 *      binding scale 1) and hardcode expected coordinates. That pins the renderer against
 *      the same mental model that produced the bug, and says nothing about the real
 *      `animation.json` files the game actually loads.
 *
 * So: real bundles, real rigs, real `RigSkin`, and RELATIONSHIPS rather than restated
 * coordinates — a part is on the body, an arm is off it, no two parts occupy one point, art
 * is scaled to the bone it's bound to. Every check here is mutation-verified: reverting
 * either half of the 2026-08-17 placement fix fails a named subset of them (see the counts
 * in ROADMAP's entry), and they hold for all 7 shipped bundles rather than one.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: anything requiring real pixels (is the eye inside the shell's
 * painted eye socket, does the art LOOK right). That still needs a live render — see
 * design/12. These are the strongest checks that survive in a canvas-free vitest run.

/**
 * ASSEMBLY INTEGRITY of the mounted weapon (2026-09-02) — the invariant this whole file is
 * about, applied to the one part of the rig that MOVES independently of its bone.
 *
 * Written because the bullet-arc fix shipped a regression past 4134 green tests, a 24-angle
 * geometry sweep and a 4-mutation battery, and one live frame caught it: the first version
 * orbited the weapon MODULE to the aim and left everything hanging off the same bone behind —
 * the socket ring, the energy tether drawn out to it, the contact shade on the core. Aiming
 * south drew the gun at (0, 6) with its ring still at (52, -49.7), 71 px away, tether reaching
 * for where the ring used to be.
 *
 * Nothing in the suite could see it, and the reason generalises: every test asserted where the
 * module IS — its mount coordinates, its muzzle point, its cross-track geometry, its depth
 * flip. None asserted that it is still ATTACHED to the thing that holds it, because a rig's
 * parts have that relationship by construction... right up until someone moves one of them out
 * of the FK chain, which is the moment the construction stops being the guarantee.
 *
 * So these assert RELATIONSHIPS between things the renderer positions INDEPENDENTLY, over the
 * real shipped bundles, swept across the aim and across every clip. Same family as "no two
 * parts occupy the same point" above, and the same reason for existing.

/**
 * The shared clip VOCABULARY, and the authoring contract that makes the additive attack layer
 * safe (`render/rigClipLayer.ts`). Both are DATA claims about the seven shipped bundles, and
 * the render layer's one unified rule rests entirely on them — no amount of correct code can
 * rescue a bundle that is missing a clip, or an attack clip that does not start at identity.
 *
 * ## What this block used to assert, and why it was rewritten (2026-09-02)
 *
 * It read "why firing is an envelope and not the authored attack clip", and pinned the two
 * facts that argument stood on: the four enemy bundles shipped NO `attack` clip, and the hero's
 * `attack` tracked only `socket_r`, so a whole-clip swap would have blanked the bones `idle`
 * bobs. Its own header called itself a tripwire — *"if either fact below flips ... that decision
 * deserves re-reading rather than silently standing on a premise that no longer holds"*. Both
 * flipped deliberately in the same pass: every bundle now ships `move` + `attack`, and the
 * overlay is additive instead of a swap, so an untracked bone is untouched rather than blanked.
 * The tripwire did its job — this is the re-read, not a silenced assertion.
 *
 * The envelope did NOT go away, and is still the only path for the aim-relative half; see
 * `rigAttackMotion.ts` for the two reasons a clip cannot express it (rig-space `translateX`,
 * and `RigSkin` overwriting every aim-tracking bone's rotation).
