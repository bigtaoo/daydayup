/**
 * The TWO-PHASE boot, driven end to end against a WeChat-shaped runtime (design/12, "the first
 * download is code only").
 *
 * `wechatAssetLoad.test.ts` proves that every shipped asset can load on this platform, through
 * the all-at-once `preloadCoreArt()`. It cannot see the thing that changed on 2026-09-01,
 * because there every pack is fetched before anything is asked of it: what a phased boot adds
 * is a WINDOW during which the lobby is live and the run art is not, and every claim about that
 * window is a claim about ORDER.
 *
 * The fake runtime is what makes order observable: a path inside a subpackage that
 * `wx.loadSubpackage` has not been called for names no file, exactly as on the device. So
 * "the UI is dressed and the rigs are not" is not asserted by reading a flag — it is the
 * consequence of only one pack having been fetched, and it would fail if `preloadLobbyArt`
 * quietly loaded everything.
 *
 * What this therefore pins:
 *   - phase one fetches the `lobby` pack and NOTHING else, and every UI texture resolves after
 *     it while every rig/weapon/biome/environment texture does not;
 *   - the run gate's `ensureRunArt()` fetches every `run`-phase pack and fills in every
 *     remaining loader — i.e. re-running a loader after its pack lands really does work, which
 *     is the property the whole design rests on;
 *   - `music` is fetched without anything awaiting it, and its arrival invalidates the music
 *     director's memo (the deck cannot retry a path whose pack was missing);
 *   - nothing is fetched twice, however many gates ask.
 *
 * What it cannot pin is everything `wechatRuntimeFake.ts`'s header lists — base-library
 * behaviour, and the GL upload. This is a strong regression net for the ORDERING, which is the
 * part that is cheap to get wrong and invisible when you do.
