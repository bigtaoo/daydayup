/**
 * What `environmentSprites`'s getters RESOLVE to once a load succeeds, which its sibling
 * `environmentSprites.test.ts` cannot see: that file lets the real (always-failing) network
 * call fail and asserts the registry stays empty, so the key each getter builds is never
 * once exercised. Same split, and the same stubbed `Assets.load`, as
 * `biomeTilesLoad.test.ts` / `taoBundle.test.ts`.
 *
 * This file exists because a mutation battery said so (2026-08-20). Two mutants survived the
 * whole suite: dropping the `pickup_` prefix from `getPickupTexture`'s lookup, and a typo in
 * `getPortalArchTexture`'s key. Both are silent — the getter returns `undefined`, which is
 * indistinguishable from "not preloaded yet", so every drop and every portal just keeps
 * drawing the Graphics fallback it is supposed to have outgrown, and no test anywhere
 * noticed. Asserting the key mapping end to end is the only thing that catches it.
