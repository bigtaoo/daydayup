// The demo runs the Ember biome as a seeded dungeon (design/05/09, ROADMAP 1.3): each
// floor is traversed room by room. The engine owns the geometry now — the render layer
// reads state.walls / state.obstacles / worldW/H per room and rebuilds on the
// `room_enter` event (RoomBuilder.build), so there are no fixed WORLD dimensions, wave
// list, or pillar layout here any more (offlineConfig.ts's own PLACEHOLDER_WORLD is
// ignored in dungeon/arena mode — each room/arena resizes the world as it loads).

// Render-side run phases (design/10). The engine only knows idle/playing/gameover;
// the main menu (the boot front door), the forge/loadout outpost (the between-run hub,
// design/14), and the result screens live here in the shell, along with score (derived
// from events). 'paused' is the in-run pause menu (design/10's own open question,
// resolved) — 'settings' also serves as the pause menu's settings sub-screen (Game
// tracks which phase to return to via settingsReturnPhase). 'squad' is the PvP
// pre-formed-party lobby (design/05/15's squad follow-up) — the first runtime (not
// boot-flag) entry point into PvP. Declared in phase.ts — shared vocabulary between
// Game and the screen layer, unit-testable without standing up a Pixi Application.
