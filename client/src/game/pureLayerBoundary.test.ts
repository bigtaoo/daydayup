/**
 * Guards the boundary of the client's PURE layer — the modules that carry run logic and must
 * stay loadable, and testable, with no browser behind them.
 *
 * ## Why the 90% coverage gate cannot do this job
 *
 * The gate's headroom is `covered / 0.9 - total`. The client sits at ~96% lines, so hundreds
 * of uncovered lines can be added before the number crosses the bar — and the headroom GROWS
 * as the tests improve. A file that imports `pixi.js` and drops into `runState.ts`'s
 * neighbourhood therefore lands inside the gated scope, adds untested lines, and the gate
 * stays comfortably green. The percentage measures how much is tested; it says nothing about
 * whether the thing is testable at all.
 *
 * The concrete failure it prevents: `runState.ts` exists because `Game.ts` could not be
 * unit-tested without a WebGL renderer (see that file's header). One `import { Container }
 * from 'pixi.js'` added to it for convenience re-creates that problem silently — every
 * existing test keeps passing, because they are already running in an environment where the
 * import happens to resolve, and the cost only shows up the next time someone tries to add a
 * test and finds they cannot.
 *
 * ## What "pure" means here, operationally
 *
 * TWO halves, and the second is the one an import-graph check alone misses:
 *
 *   (a) no runtime import may reach a module that needs a browser, transitively;
 *   (b) the file may not touch a browser global itself.
 *
 * (a) alone is a hole you can drive through — a module needs no imports at all to call
 * `document.createElement`. Type-only imports are exempt from (a): they are erased before the
 * bundle exists, and `import type { GameEngine }` costs nothing. That is why the check parses
 * import FORMS rather than grepping for the word "pixi": `import type` of a Pixi module is
 * fine and a bare `import { Container }` is not, and no substring search can tell them apart.
 *
 * Adapted from the sibling project `funny`'s `client/test/pureLayerBoundary.test.ts`, whose
 * own header records the motivating case: a scene input module that built hidden DOM
 * `<input>` overlays while importing nothing but a type, which the import-graph check alone
 * called pure.

/**
 * The pure modules. Not a directory yet, on purpose: this is the boundary as it actually
 * stands after the 2026-09-03 Game.ts split, and inventing a `logic/` directory to hold four
 * files whose callers all live one level up would be renaming rather than structuring.
 *
 * The list is short and every entry is load-bearing:
 *
 *   runState.ts        the shared lower layer the whole split rests on.
 *   ScreenNav.ts       the phase writes.
 *   OnlineMatch.ts     the queue-mode fields and the failure paths.
 *   ForgeInput.ts      the key table.
 *   weaponSlotSelect.ts the slot-picker → toggle bridge (pure since it was written).
 *
 * `gameWiring.ts` is deliberately ABSENT even though most of it qualifies: `wireWindow`
 * registers the two real `window` listeners, so the file IS the DOM adapter for the table.
 * The rule it carries — that pause and F9 are offline-only — was extracted into
 * `keydownAction`, a pure function in that same file, precisely so the rule could be tested
 * without a window even though its caller cannot be. `gameWiring.test.ts` is where that
 * happens.
 *
 * `RunLifecycle.ts` is absent for a different reason, and it is the interesting one: it imports
 * `Container` from pixi as a type only, but it also calls `child.destroy()` on the fx layer
 * and hands geometry to `RoomBuilder`, so it is a renderer collaborator whose arithmetic
 * happens to be testable with fakes — not a pure module. Listing it would make this guard a
 * lie in exactly the way it exists to prevent. Same call `funny` made for
 * `WorldMapRenderer/viewport.ts`.
