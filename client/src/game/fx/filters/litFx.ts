// Split out of fx/filters.ts (2026-08-18, 500-line convention): the directional-lighting
// filter (design/01 fidelity-roadmap milestone 2).
//
// 2026-08-24: rewritten from a PER-ACTOR filter (`NormalLitFilter`, one instance attached
// to every actor's skin, always on) into ONE screen-space pass over the whole scene layer
// (`SceneLightFilter` on `Layers.lit` = ground + shadow + entities). The per-actor form was
// measured — by the perf system ported the same day, see `src/perf/README.md` — to be the
// dominant cost of the frame: a filtered container is its own render-target pass in Pixi
// (bind target, draw, bind back, re-draw through the filter's program), so 9 on-screen
// actors meant 9 extra passes AND cut the sprite batcher into 9 pieces. 175 draw calls and
// 105 program switches for a scene of 892 nodes, render p50 10.4ms against update 0.6ms.
//
// Three things change with the move, beyond the cost:
//   * Point lights become PER-PIXEL. The old filter got one direction+intensity per actor
//     (`LightRegistry.strongestAt` at the actor's centre); this one gets every light's world
//     position and computes direction and falloff at each texel, so a light actually falls
//     off across a body instead of shading it uniformly, and several lights add up.
//   * The ENVIRONMENT is lit too — floor, walls, doors, props, portals, pickups. That is the
//     point of doing it in one pass: a muzzle flash now lights the room it goes off in, not
//     just the actors standing in it.
//   * Shading now runs AFTER each actor's own overlays (shield glow, hit flash, dissolve),
//     since it sees them already composited, where before it ran first and they layered on
//     top. Kept deliberately: the alternative is going back to per-actor passes.

/** Point lights the one pass can carry. A frame with more (a big fight throws a transient
 *  per impact, each ~170ms long) keeps the STRONGEST this many — `LightRegistry.snapshot`
 *  does the picking and is where that truncation is documented. Sized for one persistent
 *  player glow plus a burst of impacts; every slot costs a per-texel iteration over the
