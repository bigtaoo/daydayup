// Which track should be playing, decided fresh every render frame (design/11 "Music &
// ambience", built 2026-08-31).
//
// WHY A PER-FRAME DERIVATION AND NOT AN EVENT SINK. Every other sound in the game is a
// RESPONSE — an engine event (`controllers/EventReactor.ts`) or a button press
// (`audio/uiSound.ts`). Music is not: it is a function of the SITUATION, and the situation is
// already fully described by state the render layer reads every frame anyway. Deriving it has
// three properties an event-driven version would each have to earn separately:
//
//   - **Nothing to hook, so no moment can be missed.** A new screen, a new run entry point, a
//     new way to reach the boss room: all of them change the situation, and the situation is
//     what is read. An event-driven director would need a call at each of those sites, which is
//     exactly the shape of the bug where a setting applies on change but not at boot
//     (`settingsBinding.ts`'s own header records that one).
//   - **Nothing fires twice.** Setting the track that is already playing is a no-op inside
//     `MusicPlayer`, so re-entering a room, a rollback-replayed tick (design/06) or a double
//     transition cannot restart a bed. There is no de-duplication to get wrong because there is
//     no trigger.
//   - **The autoplay gate crosses itself.** While the audio context is suspended the backend's
//     `updateMusic` has nothing it can do; the frame after the first gesture resumes it, the
//     same call starts the bed. No queue, no retry, no "did we already try".
//
// WHY A MODULE SINK rather than a constructor dependency: identical reasoning to
// `audio/uiSound.ts`, and one hard constraint. The per-frame caller is `GameLoop`, which would
// have to receive the bus from `Game.ts` — and `Game.ts` is this repo's one tracked 500-line
// offender, whose baseline the length gate pins at its current size, so a new dep in its
// `GameLoopDeps` literal fails `npm run check`. The placement is also better on its own terms:
// boot is where the audio device is created, so boot is where it is attached, next to
// `setUiAudio`. UNSET IS THE SAFE STATE — with no sink attached this is a no-op, which is what
// every existing `GameLoop` test runs against.
//
// DETERMINISM (design/06/11): reads `GameState` and `Phase`, writes neither. Music is
// explicitly not determinism-relevant, so it may read anything the render layer can see.
