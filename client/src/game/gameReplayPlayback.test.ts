/**
 * Watching a recording, end to end through `Game` — the `?replay=<url>` half of the
 * feature (`match/replayPlayback.ts`), against a real recorded file.
 *
 * This is the function that SHIPPED BROKEN. `beginReplayRun` built an engine and never
 * assigned `this.engine`, so the client booted into a black screen, and the whole suite
 * stayed green: `replayPlayback.test.ts` proves `loadReplayFile`/`replayStopTick` are
 * right, `GameLoop.test.ts` proves the loop freezes at a stop tick — and both inject
 * their own engine, which is exactly the field that was missing. Same lesson as
 * `gameReplaySave.test.ts`, one function over: every piece was covered and the verb was
 * not, because nothing in the suite ever went through the real wiring.
 *
 * So the observable here is the run itself: after the boot, is the engine inside `Game`
 * the recorded stream, does it advance, does it hold at the marked moment, and is
 * everything that belongs to a LIVE run switched off.
