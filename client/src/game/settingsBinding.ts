// Split out of Game.ts (2026-08-25, 500-line convention — the quality tier pushed that file
// past its recorded baseline, and CLAUDE.md's priority order says split rather than baseline).
//
// Owns one concern: the persisted `SettingsState` and the four places a change to it has to
// land — the audio bus (design/11), the touch control layout (design/10), the render quality
// tier (`renderQuality.ts`), and the live i18n mirror (design/17). Before this, those four were
// four private methods on `Game` plus a load block plus an `onChange` closure, all of which had
// to be kept in step by hand: `applyQuality` was added to the load path and to `onChange`
// separately, which is exactly the shape of the bug where a setting applies on change but not
// at boot.
//
// Form (2) from CLAUDE.md: the cross-boundary call list is `load`/`update`/`state` outward and
// the three-member `deps` object below inward, each narrowed to the methods actually used rather
// than being a handle on the whole `AudioBus`/`InputSource`/`RenderQualityController`.
