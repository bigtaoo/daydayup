// Two callers, one class:
//
//   - BOOT, from `main.ts` / `main.wechat.ts`, via `showBootLoading(app)`. This runs before
//     `new Game(...)` exists, so it takes the Pixi `Application` directly and parks itself on
//     `app.stage`. It is the only thing on screen while the `lobby` pack downloads.
//   - THE RUN GATE, from `game/controllers/ArtGate.ts`, on `Layers.overlay`.
//
// Graphics + Text only, and deliberately so: at boot the `lobby` pack has not landed, so
// `getUiTexture('hub')` is undefined and every art-backed widget (`Panel`, `Button`) would
// paint its fallback anyway. Drawing the fallback shape on purpose is honest and half the code.
//
// The spin is driven by a ticker callback the screen owns and removes on `destroy()`. It is
// wall-clock, not frame-count: a boot that stalls on a slow download must still visibly move.
