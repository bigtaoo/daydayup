// Pure minimap math (design/10 "room progress"), decoupled from Pixi so it's unit-
// testable the same way the engine's own content converters are (content/arenas.ts
// buildArenaGeometry). `computeMinimapLayout`/`roomStatus` are PvP's own math, fed
// straight from `state.arenaMap`/`state.zone` (already the exact `ArenaMap`/`Door`
// shape). `dungeonToArenaMap`/`dungeonRoomStatus` (design/05 "fully-realized
// branching" follow-up, 2026-08-05) are the PvE-side adapter this file used to just
// name as a future follow-up: PvE's placed-room data (`PlacedRoom`/`DoorRuntime`,
// `world/dungeon.ts`/`GameState.ts`) is structurally similar but a distinct type from
// `ArenaMap`, so it converts once here rather than teaching `computeMinimapLayout` two
// input shapes. Both modes now share the exact same `Minimap` Pixi widget
// (`Minimap.ts`) — PvE retired its own separate progress-track widget
// (`FloorProgress.ts`/`floorProgressMath.ts`, deleted this pass) in favor of the real
// spatial map, which a floor with a real fork (siblings placed off the spine's y=0)
// genuinely needs: a linear array-index track can't represent an untaken sibling
// (it'd show as a phantom step, or read "done" once its index is passed).

 * Convert PvE's placed-room/door data into the same `ArenaMap` shape

 * name this as the only missing piece, and design/05's "fully-realized branching"
 * pass (2026-08-05) is what made it worth actually writing: a fork's siblings have
 * real, non-zero `offsetYGrid` (stacked off the spine), so a PvE floor is genuinely
 * 2D now, not just a 1D spine a plain progress track could already represent.
 * `Door{roomA,roomB,passageGrid}` is already the exact type PvP uses (design/09
 * "reused verbatim") — `dr.door` needs no field remapping at all.
 *
 * Room offsets can be negative (a fork's siblings are stacked centered on the fork
 * point, so one sibling typically lands above y=0) — `computeMinimapLayout` assumes
 * every room's `rectGrid` sits within `[0,sizeGrid.w] x [0,sizeGrid.h]` (the
 * invariant every hand-authored PvP `ArenaMap` already satisfies), so this shifts
 * every room by the floor's own minimum x/y before handing it off, rather than
 * teaching the layout function about negative offsets. `id`/`spawns`/`eyeCandidates`
 * are inert for minimap purposes (unread by `computeMinimapLayout`) — filled with a
 * placeholder/empty value rather than left to invent meaning that isn't there.
