/**
 * The floor-card offer (design/05/10, ENGINE_VERSION 58) — three upgrade cards shown
 * above the portal popup once a floor is cleared, one of which the squad picks before
 * descending.
 *
 * Non-blocking, like every other in-match overlay here: the sim keeps running behind it
 * (design/06 — lockstep cannot pause for one player), so this is a panel the player
 * chooses from while standing at the portal, never a modal that stops the game. It sits
 * above `PortalPrompt` and shares its lifecycle: `Game` shows both on the same
 * "cleared, and standing at the portal" condition.
 *
 * Pure presentation. Tapping a card calls `onVote(slot)`, which `Game` routes to
 * `CommandBuilder.requestCardVote` — the engine owns what a vote does, this owns what it
 * looks like, same split as `PortalPrompt`/`PauseMenu`.
 *
 * ## The tally is drawn, not just the cards
 *
 * In co-op the winning card is the most-voted one, so a player has to be able to see
 * where the squad's votes currently sit — otherwise "the majority decides" is a rule
 * whose outcome only becomes visible after it has already happened. Each card shows a
 * vote count once anyone has voted, and the local seat's own pick is drawn selected.
 * With one player there is no ambiguity to resolve, so the counts stay hidden.
