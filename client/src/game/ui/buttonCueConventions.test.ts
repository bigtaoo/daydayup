/**
 * The UI-cue conventions, swept over EVERY `new Button(...)` in the client rather than sampled
 * (design/11 "The UI cues").
 *
 * `gameUiSound.test.ts` presses real buttons on real screens, which is the stronger evidence —
 * but it can only assert the call sites someone thought to list, and the decision this pass
 * spread across ~14 screen files is per-call-site: a button that dismisses a screen must say
 * `sound: 'ui.back'`, a settings option `sound: 'ui.toggle'`, and only the two buttons whose
 * OUTCOME picks the cue may be `'silent'`. The failure mode is a new screen shipping a BACK
 * button that sounds like a forward one — which on a phone is the same finger in nearly the
 * same place, and is the kind of thing nobody files a bug about.
 *
 * So this reads the source. It is crude, deliberately: the alternative is a runtime registry of
 * every Button ever constructed, which is machinery in shipped code to serve a test. The guards
 * against a crude sweep going vacuous — the real risk with a regex, since a regex that matches
 * nothing passes everything — are the floors at the bottom: the number of buttons found, the
 * number of dismiss buttons among them, and a hard failure on any construction shape the parser
 * cannot classify.
