/**
 * The menu/overlay layer and the one piece of policy that belongs to it: every
 * full-screen screen (MainMenu/ModeSelect/Forge/Settings/…) is laid out in a fixed
 * DESIGN space and the whole layer is scaled DOWN to fit viewports smaller than it,
 * rather than each screen re-flowing its own layout per viewport.
 *
 * Why this exists (live bug, 2026-08-25, WeChat mini-game on an iPhone 12/13):
 * `wechat/game.json` declares `deviceOrientation: "landscape"`, so the mini-game
 * viewport is 844x390 logical px — about half the height every menu screen was
 * written against. The Forge's blueprint grid alone flows to y≈509, while its fixed
 * bottom action bar sits at `h - 60` = 330, so START RUN was drawn *on top of* the
 * still-there weapon cards and read as "the button to enter the map isn't there"
 * (reported as 卡在选武器的页面). Every other screen was over-tall too, by less:
 * measured minimum heights were Forge 540 (570 to also clear its own bottom bar),
 * Settings 485, LoginScreen 405, PvpPreview/PartyScreen 400, ModeSelect 380,
 * Screens 370, MainMenu 330 — against a 390px viewport.
 *
 * A uniform fit-scale fixes all of them at once and keeps one layout per screen. The
 * cost is density: at 844x390 the scale is 0.61, so a 12px label renders at ~7 CSS px
 * (~15 device px at the phone's pixelRatio 2). Re-flowing the Forge grid wider-and-
 * shorter on a very wide viewport would buy that back and is the follow-up if the
 * shrink reads too small on a real handset — it is not a correctness issue.
 *
 * Never scales UP (`Math.min(1, …)`): on any viewport at or above the design size this
 * is the identity transform, so desktop web is bit-for-bit unchanged.
 *
 * NOT the in-run HUD or the touch controls — those live in `Layers.ui` outside this
 * container and stay in real screen space, where a thumbstick that is physically
 * thumb-sized matters more than matching the menus' density.

   * backdrop, where it was invisible and untappable at every viewport, desktop included.
