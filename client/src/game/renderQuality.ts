// Split out of Game.ts (2026-08-25, 500-line convention). Owns one concern: turning the
// persisted quality SETTING plus the frame watchdog's verdict into the renderer configuration
// that the tier describes (`render/quality.ts`).
//
// Form (2) from CLAUDE.md, not (1): there is per-instance state to hold — the watchdog's latch
// and the platform's own resolution — so the alternative would be threading both through every
// call. The cross-boundary call list is three methods in one direction (`apply`, `observeWindow`,
// `pin`) and the four-member `deps` object below in the other, each narrowed to just what is
// used rather than being a handle on `FxController`/`Scene`/`Application`.
//
// Nothing here reads or writes engine state: a quality tier is presentation-only, which is what
// keeps two clients on different tiers byte-identical in simulation (design/06/12).
