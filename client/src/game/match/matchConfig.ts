/**
 * Build the run config from `match_start`. MUST be byte-identical on every client
 * (determinism, design/06), so it derives ONLY from the shared seed + playerCount:
 * seats are skinned by index (distinct, agreed characters), and neither the local
 * chosen character nor the crafted loadout enters — carrying those into online play
 * needs them to travel through matchmaking first (a later step).
 *
 * `m.mode === 'pvp'` (design/15, ROADMAP Phase 4 closeout) branches to the arena
 * shape instead (buildPvpEngineConfig, shared with server/src/BotClient.ts) — setting
 * `arena` is what flips `state.zoneEnabled` and turns on ZoneSystem/EnvironmentSystem/
 * the placement win condition, AND (ENGINE_VERSION 20, ROADMAP 4.2c) what makes
 * `GameState.buildSeat` resolve each seat's weapons/HP through `buildArenaSpecs`
 * instead of the PvE run-builder path — no `loadout` needs setting here at all, since
 * an arena seat never reads it.
