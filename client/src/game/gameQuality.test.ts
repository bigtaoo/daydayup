/**
 * The quality tier, end to end through `Game` (2026-08-25).
 *
 * The unit tests either side of this one cover the table (`render/quality.test.ts`), the
 * downgrade policy (`render/qualityWatchdog.test.ts`) and the two consumers
 * (`fx/FxController.test.ts`, `scene/Actor.test.ts`). What none of them can see is the WIRING:
 * whether a settings tap or a slow window actually reaches the renderer. That is the part that
 * has historically shipped broken here — design/04's item 12 was an entire interaction system
 * that rendered perfectly and was connected to nothing.
 *
 * So every case below asserts an observable the RENDERER reads: the resolution the renderer is
 * running at, and the filters mounted on the scene layers.
