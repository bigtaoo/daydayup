// Split out of RoomBuilder (2026-08-18, 500-line convention + separation of concerns): how a
// standing wall is DRAWN. `wallGeometry.ts` decides how tall each segment is, `wallRuns.ts`
// which footprints are one mass; this file turns one footprint + height into the extruded
// block Entity and the shadow it throws on the floor. Free functions over a Graphics/Entity —
// no scene state, no room model. Pillars live in the sibling `pillarRender.ts`; both read their
// tones from `wallTone.ts`, so everything standing in a room agrees on where the light is.
//
// This is the pass that answers the user's report *"墙看起来还是没有高度感，就像一张图贴在地
// 上"*. Standing walls already existed; what was missing was every cue that says a solid
// object is sitting ON a floor rather than printed INTO it:
//
//   1. **No cast shadow at all.** The pillars had one (`Entity.makeShadow`); a 70 px wall had
//      none. design/01 calls a height-driven shadow "the cheapest 3D cheat" and the walls
//      were the one tall thing in the room not using it.
//   2. **Cap and face were the same brightness.** The cap reused `wall_<element>.png` — the
//      same top-down swatch a FLAT wall is drawn with — at tint 0xffffff, so a surface
//      raised 70 px and a surface lying on the ground were pixel-for-pixel equally lit.
//   3. **No side thickness.** A block's east/west sides project to exactly zero width under
//      `screen.y = gy - z` (there is no horizontal skew in this projection), so a
//      north-south run showed only a cap and a small end face. The east side is now drawn
//      as an INSET dark band — a deliberate cheat, inset rather than extruded so it can
//      never overlap the neighbouring segment of the same run.
//
// Fourth pass, 2026-08-19, on a screenshot of level 1's start room — *"那段墙体看起来很奇
// 怪"*, pointing at the west perimeter run. All three defects it found are the same defect: every
// number here had been tuned on an EAST-WEST wall, where the cap is a 32 px band under a lit
// coping, and then applied unchanged to a north-south run, where the cap is 100% of what you see
// of the wall (224 px deep on the wall in question). Measured/A-B'd on the live frame:
//
//   4. **A flat additive key light on the cap** hit its target luma and flattened the swatch's
//      contrast RATIO from 2:1 to 1.4:1, so the wall read as pale concrete rather than stone.
//      Now a second copy of the swatch in `add` mode — same value, ratio intact (`CAP_BOOST_*`).
//   5. **The cap tiled from each block's own origin**, so a 64 px-wide run always windowed the
//      same left quarter of a 256 px swatch (on ember: one large stone, no pattern), and an L
//      corner met at a mismatched seam. Now tiled in world space.
//   6. **The east band and west chamfer spanned the block's whole art**, which on a north-south
//      run is a 13 px flat grey panel painted down 224 px of the wall's top. Now bounded to one
//      wall thickness of cap plus a taper (`SIDE_CAP_SOLID_PX`), with a narrow bevel
//      (`CAP_EDGE_*`) along the rest.
//
// ...and the report after that one — *"竖着的墙，直接盖在了横着的墙上面"* — was the SAME wall's
// corner, and its cause is `mergeWallRuns` merging only pairs whose union is a rectangle: an L or
// T corner is always two blocks, and each drew its full "this is where I end" set right in the
// middle of one continuous stone top. `wallRuns.wallJoins` now tells a block which of its edges
// are buried in a corner, and `WallJoins` masks the coping, the silhouette, the cap gradient and
// the fold out of them. See that function for the measured 66 -> 79 step this removes.
//
// ...and the report after THAT one changed the rule instead of a number: *"中间的墙体处理的很好，
// 但是上面那段就不对了"*. A seamless corner was never the ask. A block's art intrudes one wall
// HEIGHT north of its own footprint, so a deep north-south run climbs the far wall's brick face
// and interrupts the one surface the eye is using as the room's back wall. Such a run now TUCKS
// (`WallJoins.tuckNorth`): its cap is clipped so it stops just under that wall's CROWN course, the
// longest unbroken horizontal line in the room stays unbroken, and the junction — now a re-entrant
// corner rather than an overlap — gets a crease on both surfaces (`TUCK_*`). A deliberate
// stylisation, not a correction: the run's stone really is nearer than the brick it hides.
//
// The clip line took one more round to place. Stopping the run at the wall's FOOT was tried first
// and rejected (*"应该要覆盖到我标记的区域"*, over the brick above the run): the run is entitled to
// stand in front of the brick, just not in front of the crown. See `wallRuns.WallJoins` for the
// measurement that placed it and why only DEEP runs may tuck at all.
