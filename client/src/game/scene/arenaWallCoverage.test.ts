/**
 * The five wall-content sweeps, run against the map a PvP match actually builds.
 *
 * **WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.** `wallComposition.test.ts`, `occlusionCoverage.test.ts`,
 * `doorStandCoverage.test.ts`, `doorSpillCoverage.test.ts` and `doorOcclusionCoverage.test.ts`
 * are this repo's answer to a failure mode it has shipped: a geometric predicate that reads
 * correctly, passes its unit tests on hand-built fixtures, and silently matches NOTHING in the
 * real level (`wallGeometry`'s old `w > h` guard left 1 wall standing where 32 should). Each of
 * them answers it by sweeping REAL content through the REAL pipeline.
 *
 * Every one of them sweeps `EMBER_L1_FLOORS` — the five PvE floors — and nothing else. The
 * arena had no walls at all until `arena_launch` was authored (2026-08-25), so there was
 * nothing to sweep; now there is, and it is a different shape of content by an order of
 * magnitude: 60 rooms against a PvE floor's 5-8, 25 distinct footprints, 492 authored wall
 * rects, rooms adjacent on both axes (a PvE floor has 11 stacked boundaries in total; this map
 * has 44), 124 pillars, and 74 authored passages. A rule tuned on 27 runs of level 1 can be
 * vacuous, or wrong, or merely out of headroom here without anything else noticing.
 *
 * So: `arena_launch` through `buildArenaGeometry` → `wallTier` → `mergeWallRuns` → `wallJoins`
 * → the passage clip (`RoomBuilder.build`'s own sequence for an arena — the same sequence minus
 * the door FIXTURES, which stay dungeon-only; see the door section), then the same questions the
 * five files ask of the PvE floors. Offline, deterministic, ~1s — with one test that drives the
 * real `RoomBuilder` end to end, because a harness that only mirrors the pipeline cannot notice
 * the pipeline changing under it.
 *
 * **What this pass found** (full account in ROADMAP's "The Seven Districts"):
 *
 *   1. The three DOOR sweeps had no subject at all here, and that was a real defect. `GameState`
 *      populates `dungeonDoors` only in dungeon mode, so `RoomBuilder`'s door-rect list was empty
 *      on every arena — `bordersDoorNorth` never fired, `doorClip`/`effectiveWallHeight` never
 *      ran, and 36 of the map's 74 authored passages were completely buried under the cap of the
 *      wall run standing south of them, 58 covered to some degree. FIXED 2026-08-26 by unioning
 *      `arenaMap.doors` into that list: 0 buried, 10 still partly covered by a run (worst 40 px
 *      of a 96 px passage), and the worn floor patch now marks all 74 thresholds. Door FIXTURES
 *      remain dungeon-only — an arena `Door` is an adjacency record with no lock and no leaf.
 *   2. `occludes` fires for 4 blocks at once at exactly one spot — a 2x2 pillar cluster — where
 *      `occlusionCoverage.test.ts` asserts at most 2. Walls alone still never exceed 2.
 *   3. The arena hides the player more than twice as often as a PvE floor (7.8% of standable
 *      floor fully hidden vs 3.3%), and takes the deep fade 5x as often (1.07% vs 0.2%). Both
 *      were higher before finding 1 was fixed (11.6% and 1.37%) — 44 runs got shorter with it.
 *   4. The shading float budget has half the headroom it does in PvE: the worst arena block is
 *      208 floats against a PvE worst of 120, which is over `wallComposition.test.ts`'s own
 *      `< AUTO_BATCH_VERTEX_LIMIT / 2` bound. Still batchable (the line is 400), but the bound
 *      that guards it was measured on the wrong content.
 *   5. One PvE case genuinely does not occur here (a room boundary only PARTLY covered by the
 *      room above, which `wallTier` answers per rect and `mergeWallRuns` then refuses to merge).
 *      Asserted as absent WITH its precondition, so "0" reads as a fact about the map rather
 *      than as a sweep that stopped looking.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here, and the reason this file exists before a browser is opened: whether any
 * of it LOOKS right. This is the list of places to point a camera at.
 *
 * **The camera was pointed at all five, 2026-08-27** (real Chrome, `?arena=arena_launch`, the
 * coordinates taken from this file's own sweeps rather than hunted for by hand — ROADMAP's "The
 * camera list, answered" has the method and the frames). Every one came back acceptable:
 *
 *   1. The 2x2 colonnade at `terraces_r1c0` (336, 536) reads as **four columns going hazy**, not as
 *      a hole: each pillar keeps a legible silhouette outline while its body ghosts out, and an
 *      un-faded pillar two cells away is right there in frame as the contrast.
 *   2. `cisterns_r1c3`, the worst-hidden room, keeps the character fully visible; the wall block it
 *      fades reads as a translucent slab over the solid stone behind it.
 *   3. The deep pass (front FACE dropped too) reads as a glass block with hard edges — the one
 *      verdict with a reservation, since a ghosted rectangle is more "pane" than "x-rayed stone".
 *   4. The 208-float 672x64 KERB draws its three south spans with no seam between them.
 *   5. Passage 63's residual 40 px of 160 is imperceptible standing in the doorway.
 *
 * What the same pass DID find is not in this file's remit and is recorded in ROADMAP: the map's 12
 * deliberately-empty grid cells read as hard-edged black rectangles (~20% of a 16:9 frame from the
 * room next door) wherever the void is EAST or WEST of the player, because only a void to the SOUTH
 * puts a wall run's top surface and dark face between the player and it.
