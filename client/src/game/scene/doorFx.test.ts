/**
 * `doorFx.ts` — one door's motion, assembled.
 *
 * The claim this file exists to pin is the DIRECTION one, because it is the whole design and it is
 * the one thing no other test can see. `doorFx`'s own doc says a locked door's motion is CONTAINED
 * (flame rises inside the leaf, the scan bar bounces between the jambs, the floor pulse travels
 * INWARD) and an open door's CROSSES the threshold (light streams down and out, motes drift onto
 * the floor, the pulse travels OUTWARD). Every one of those is a sign — of a scroll delta, of a
 * radius delta — and a sign is exactly what survives a refactor looking correct while being
 * backwards. Two of the three sign pairs here are literally one character apart in the source.
 *
 * The rest is the state machine around it: the crossfade, the one-shot burst, the refusal flash,
 * the proximity ramp, and the x-ray proxy that exists because `occlusion.fadeGroup` and this class
 * would otherwise both own the same `alpha`.
