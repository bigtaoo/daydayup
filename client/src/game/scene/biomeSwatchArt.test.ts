/**
 * The SHIPPED biome swatches themselves, decoded and measured — all five elements, all three
 * kinds (2026-08-25). Sibling to `pillarArt.test.ts`, and for the same reason it exists: every
 * other test in this directory checks what the renderer does with a texture, and the things that
 * go wrong with these files are invisible to any test of the code.
 *
 * Written when `poison` landed — the last element of design/13's LOCKED five-colour language with
 * no art of its own. It is a sweep over all five rather than a poison-specific check on purpose:
 * the properties below are what makes the set a SET (one tonal family, one camera, one seam rule),
 * and the recurring bug in this repo is a per-element file that satisfies its own spec and
 * disagrees with its neighbours — measured twice already, in the per-element pillar attempt
 * (`art/biome/prompts.md`) and in the four face swatches' crown rows (`wallTone.ts`).
 *
 * Poison additionally carries a HARD gameplay clause the other four do not, from design/13's
 * "environment desaturated, hazards saturated": *"the poison biome's ambient green must be dialled
 * down … or green FX/enemies camouflage against a green floor."* A green floor is not a style
 * miss here, it is the poison bullet and the poison-tinted mob becoming invisible. That clause is
 * asserted on the pixels, because it is exactly the kind of thing that looks fine in a preview.
 *
 * Import steps this pins as having actually run (nothing else records them):
 *   - downsample to a 256 px long axis (`compress.mjs`)
 *   - the elevation's border crop + top-half crop + bottom re-darken, which is what makes
 *     `wallface_poison` 256x128 rather than the 1254x1254 the generator returned
