/**
 * `groundLayer.ts` — the ground stage as a whole (2026-08-20). Everything here was found by a
 * mutation battery over the floor pass rather than written alongside it: `floorRender.test.ts` pins
 * what each layer DRAWS, and every one of those tests still passed with the layers mounted in the
 * wrong order, with the additive layer not additive, with the per-room seed replaced by an array
 * index, and with the door wear removed altogether. Those are the four assertions below.
 *
 * The fifth is the region split — which rects get a floor (coverage) versus which get an identity
 * (wash/mottle/decals/light). `floorCoverage.test.ts` measures WHY they differ; this pins that the
 * two functions actually answer differently.
