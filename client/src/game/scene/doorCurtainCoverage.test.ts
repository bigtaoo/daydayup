/**
 * Does the 2026-08-30b curtain-of-light actually stand where it should on the SHIPPED content?
 *
 * Sibling of `doorLightCoverage.test.ts` (same lineage as `doorStandCoverage`/`doorSpillCoverage`):
 * same pipeline (`placeAuthoredFloor` → `buildFloorGeometry` → `wallTier` → `mergeWallRuns` →
 * `doorFlankTier`), same five floors, but asking about the curtain sprite specifically.
 *
 * The reason this file exists rather than trusting `doorRender.test.ts`'s hand-built PASSAGE rect:
 * that suite caught the curtain's SIZE and VISIBILITY being right while its POSITION defaulted to
 * (0, 0) and drew below the threshold into the room floor instead of up into the opening — found
 * live, not by any test, because nothing there checked where the sprite actually stood. A single
 * hand-built fixture proves the bug is fixed on THAT shape; this sweep is what stops a
 * shape-dependent variant of the same mistake (say, one that only shows up when `drawH` rounds a
 * particular way) from shipping unnoticed on the other 23 doors nobody looked at.
