// New 2026-09-03 (CLAUDE.md form 1 — an independent module beside `doorRender.ts`/`doorLights.ts`,
// which is also what kept doorRender.ts under the 500-line convention): everything about a door
// that MOVES. `doorLights.ts` holds the still layers, each drawn once at build time and thereafter
// only toggled by `.visible`; this file holds the clock and the layers that read it.
//
// **WHY.** Three passes (2026-08-30 through/spill/rim, 2026-08-30b the illustrated curtain,
// 2026-09-03 one door height) each added more STILL layers to a fixture the player still read as
// flat — *"目前的形式太死板了"*. The diagnosis that ended that run was not that the cue was weak: a
// door had no per-frame path reaching it at all. `Scene.interpolate` walks `Scene.views`, and a
// door is a fixture `RoomBuilder` adds straight to `layers.entities`, so nothing was ever going to
// animate one. (The same gap had quietly frozen `Portal` — its whole `interpolate` body, four
// animated layers, had no caller. `RoomBuilder.tickFixtures` now drives both.)
//
// **WHAT THE CLOCK BUYS, AND WHY IT IS SPENT ON DIRECTION.** A still image can only say a thing
// with COLOUR and SHAPE, and both were already spent — the two states share one pool shape and
// differ by hue (`doorLights.GLOW_POOL`). Motion adds three more channels, and this file assigns
// them deliberately rather than just making everything wobble:
//
//   direction — the whole read. A LOCKED door's motion is CONTAINED: flame scrolls upward inside
//               the leaf, a scan bar ping-pongs side to side between the jambs, and its floor
//               pulse travels INWARD. Nothing crosses the threshold. An OPEN door's motion CROSSES
//               it: light streams down and out of the passage, motes drift out onto the floor
//               toward the player, and its floor pulse travels OUTWARD. "Can I walk through this"
//               is answered by which way things are moving, at any size, before colour is read.
//   rhythm    — locked is fast and restless (1.7 s / 2.75 s beating against each other, an
//               irrational-ish ratio so they never realign); open is one slow 2.4 s breath that
//               the curtain, the spill pool and the ramp all share, so they read as ONE lit
//               passage rather than three stacked decals.
//   reaction  — the channel a still door could not have at all: `near` brightens a door as the
//               player approaches, and `reject()` flashes it when they walk into a locked one.
//
// **NO NEW ART, AND WHY THAT WAS THE CHEAPER ANSWER.** The obvious way to animate fire is a frame
// sequence, and the obvious way to get one here is to ask an image model for N frames — which is
// exactly what this project has already found does not work (`design/12`: GPT Image 2 "emits one
// flattened raster", the reason the portal is "a split, not a sprite… the file is the half of the
// object that never moves"). So the motion is generated, not prompted: two seamless fields baked
// by `shadeRamp.bakedField` (zero bytes against design/04's package budget, POT + mipmappable,
// readable back by a test) scrolled under the shipped stills. The stills keep supplying the
// MATERIAL, which is what an image model is actually good at.
