// Split out of Actor.ts (2026-08-21, 500-line convention): the in-world floating health bar
// every actor carries above its head (design/10 legibility). A pure drawing function over a
// caller-owned Graphics — no state, no Pixi container of its own — so Actor keeps owning when
// to redraw and this file owns what the bar looks like.
//
// Procedural on purpose, not a texture: it is a HUD readout that has to resize per actor
// (a boss's is wider and taller than a mob's) and recolour per frame, which is exactly what
// Graphics is for.
//
// ── Why it looks like this (measured 2026-08-21, not styled by eye) ──────────────────────
//
// The previous bar was a near-black track at alpha 0.85 with a 1 px near-black stroke. Both
// halves of that failed the same way, and the failure only shows up in numbers: because the
// track was TRANSLUCENT, its rendered luma was a function of whatever the actor happened to
// be standing in front of. Sampled over 18 placements in a real room, the empty track came
// out anywhere from 25.6 to 57.1 luma, and its separation from the surface behind it
// collapsed as that surface darkened — down to 1.6-2.9 luma over the dark floors mobs
// actually stand on (measured backgrounds ran 27 to 75 luma in one room). At 1/3 HP the
// player therefore saw an amber stub with no visible remainder: no length to read the
// fraction against. The 1 px stroke drifted the same way, 17.5 to 61.9.
//
// The fix is not "pick a better single colour" — no single value can separate from both a
// 27-luma floor and an 88-luma wall cap. It is to give the bar its own two-tone frame and
// make every layer OPAQUE, so the whole thing renders at a constant value everywhere and
// carries a guaranteed cue in both directions:
//
//   - a near-black outer contour (~11 luma) reads against everything bright
//   - a light top bevel (~124 luma over the track) reads against everything dark
//
// Whichever surface the bar lands on, one of those two has >= 49 luma of separation from it,
// and neither moves when the background does. `healthBar.test.ts` pins that invariant against
// the real measured background range rather than against a screenshot.
//
// One extra opaque layer per bar, drawn only when the hp fraction actually changes
// (`Actor.setHealth` early-returns otherwise), so a room of full-health mobs costs nothing.
