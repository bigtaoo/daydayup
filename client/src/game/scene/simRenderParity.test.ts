/**
 * Where the RENDERER derives an ENGINE constant in prose, this file closes the loop by importing
 * it (design/18-test-strategy.md, gap **G6**, Layer 2).
 *
 * **WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.** Three separate rules in `client/src/game/scene/` are justified by
 * arithmetic over `PLAYER_BASE.solidRadius` and `WALL_NORTH_BRIM`, and not one of them imports
 * either constant:
 *
 *   1. `wallGeometry.WALL_H_KERB = 22` is argued from "the player's ground point stays
 *      `PLAYER_BASE.solidRadius` (16 px) north of the kerb's own north edge", so a 22 px lip
 *      "reaches at most 6 px up a body".
 *   2. `occlusion.MIN_COVER_FRACTION = 0.45` re-derives that SAME 6 px from that SAME premise,
 *      in its own words, to justify its own number.
 *   3. `wallGeometry.wallTier` decides "is this an interior block" from room-rect edge proximity
 *      (`EDGE_TOLERANCE = 4`); the sim decides the same thing from `AABB.freeStanding`. Two
 *      independent classifiers over the same rects, and nothing compares them.
 *
 * A prose derivation is not a guard. Change `solidRadius` and both comments quietly become
 * false while every test stays green — which is the exact failure mode design/18 catalogued
 * (`WALL_NORTH_BRIM`'s own doc comment cited a `standingCoverParity.test.ts` that was never
 * created). So: compute the 6 px instead of restating it, and sweep the shipped content for
 * classifier disagreement rather than assuming there is none.
 *
 * Content is the five shipped ember floors through the real pipeline (`placeAuthoredFloor` →
 * `buildFloorGeometry`), the same setup `occlusionCoverage.test.ts` uses. Comparison is per
 * AUTHORED rect, deliberately before `mergeWallRuns`: `freeStanding` is a per-rect engine flag
 * and a merge that unions two rects has nowhere to put a disagreement.
 *
 * ## What the sweep found, and it is not zero
 *
 * **The five shipped floors contain 198 wall rects and ZERO `freeStanding` ones.** The renderer
 * stands 34 of them at `WALL_H_INTERIOR` (70 px); the sim brims none of them. So the `⟺` design/18
 * asked for is currently `interior ⇒ NOT freeStanding` on 34 rects out of 34 — the two classifiers
 * agree on nothing at all, because one of them never fires.
 *
 * That is a fact about CONTENT, not about either rule. `freeStanding` is authored, and the
 * level-1 pieces are JSON under `world/dungeons/ember/pieces/` seeded before v47 existed; the
 * hand-authored TypeScript pool (`world/rooms/ember.ts`) does set it, and so does the launch
 * arena, which is why `engine/fixtures/brimGrinderFloor.ts`'s header can say "dungeon mode does
 * have free-standing blocks" and be right about the pool while being wrong about the level that
 * ships. The consequence is that ENGINE_VERSION 47's fix for *"角色...感觉陷进去了"* is inert over
 * the whole of PvE level 1.
 *
 * Is that SAFE? Yes, in the direction that matters, and the tests below assert both halves:
 *
 *   - The dangerous direction is EMPTY: no rect is brimmed by the sim while the renderer draws it
 *     as a perimeter ring or a kerb. A brimmed kerb would re-open the v43 report from the
 *     opposite side (`WALL_NORTH_BRIM`'s "Only free-standing blocks"), and a brimmed perimeter
 *     ring would narrow every door passage from both sides.
 *   - The direction that IS populated only costs visual polish: a player standing 16 px rather
 *     than 39 px north of a 70 px-tall block is more covered, not less, and `occludes` already
 *     fires there (`occlusionCoverage.test.ts` sweeps it). Nothing becomes unreachable and no
 *     pickup becomes uncollectable, because `clampToWalkable` reads the same flag the movement
 *     resolver does — both see "not free-standing" and agree.
 *
 * So the count below is a RECORDED MEASUREMENT, not a green light. It is written to fail the day
 * anyone authors `freeStanding` into level 1 — at which point this file is the thing that makes
 * them look at the tier rule too, which is the whole point of a parity sweep.
 *
 * ## Mutation battery — what these assertions are measured to catch
 *
 * Recorded 2026-08-30 at ENGINE_VERSION 48. Each mutation was applied to the SOURCE constant,
 * this file run alone, then reverted (`git diff --stat` clean afterwards).
 *
 *   KILLED   engine PLAYER_BASE.solidRadius 16 px -> 12 px .......... 4 failing tests
 *   KILLED   wallGeometry.EDGE_TOLERANCE 4 -> 140 .................. 5
 *   KILLED   wallGeometry.WALL_H_KERB 22 -> 26 ..................... 3
 *   KILLED   occlusion.MIN_COVER_FRACTION 0.45 -> 0.20 ............. 2
 *   KILLED   wallGeometry.WALL_H_INTERIOR 70 -> 96 ................. 2
 *   KILLED   engine WALL_NORTH_BRIM 23 px -> 2 px .................. 2
 *   KILLED   engine WALL_NORTH_BRIM 23 px -> 21 px ................. 1
 *   SURVIVED engine WALL_NORTH_BRIM 23 px -> 24 px
 *   SURVIVED wallGeometry.EDGE_TOLERANCE 4 -> 40
 *
 * The two engine rows are the ones this file exists for: before it, changing `solidRadius` broke
 * nothing in the client at all, and both renderer comments derived from it stayed green while
 * becoming false.
 *
 * Both survivors are honest and both are informative rather than gaps to paper over:
 *
 *   - `WALL_NORTH_BRIM 23 -> 24` survives because every claim about the brim here is a ONE-SIDED
 *     inequality and 24 px is on the safe side of all of them. The pair `21 KILLED / 22 SURVIVED`
 *     locates the boundary exactly, and locating it is the point: "the thinnest free-standing
 *     block clears `WALL_H_INTERIOR` by one pixel" is a measurement this battery reproduces
 *     rather than a phrase in a comment.
 *   - `EDGE_TOLERANCE 4 -> 40` survives because the tightest interior block on any shipped floor
 *     is 128 px clear of its room's nearest bound (asserted below), so a 10x widening still
 *     reclassifies nothing. 140 crosses that margin and kills 5 tests. This file therefore gates
 *     the tolerance's EFFECT on real content, not its value — which is the right granularity for
 *     a constant whose own comment calls it fixed-point conversion slack.
