/**
 * Does the 2026-09-03b door-fx pass actually fire on the SHIPPED content — and does every branch
 * of it occur there?
 *
 * `doorFx.test.ts` and `doorMotion.test.ts` pin the mechanism on rects this session chose. That is
 * the right way to test a rule and the wrong way to find out whether the rule ever runs, and this
 * repo has shipped that exact failure twice: `wallGeometry`'s old `w > h` guard left 1 wall
 * standing where 32 should because level 1's rooms are almost all `w <= h`, and
 * `doorSpillCoverage.test.ts` found a shallow-run case firing 12 times across the shipped floors
 * that had been written off as hypothetical. Sibling of `doorStandCoverage`/`doorLightCoverage`,
 * same pipeline, asking about the MOTION.
 *
 * The specific way this pass could be vacuous, and the reason this file exists at all: the flame
 * overlay is sized off `flameBandRect`, which maps a band measured on the art through the leaf's
 * own TOP crop. On a kerb door that crop removes most of the file. If the shipped art and the
 * shipped opening heights combined to leave a few pixels of band — or none — the fix would look
 * right on the one door someone opened the game to and do nothing on the other 23, and no unit
 * test built from a chosen rect could tell.
