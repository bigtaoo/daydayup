/**
 * Composition invariants over every wall of every SHIPPED level-1 room, plus the one
 * cross-layer check that the corner treatment depends on: that `FACE_CROWN_FRACTION` still
 * describes the real `wallface_<element>.png` on disk.
 *
 * **WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.** One wall — `ember_l1_cell`'s west perimeter run — was reported wrong
 * four times in a row on 2026-08-19, and every round shipped a green suite. The tests written each
 * round were not wrong, they were the wrong *class*: `wallRender.test.ts` and `wallRuns.test.ts`
 * pin one block, or one pair of hand-written rects, against numbers chosen by the same person who
 * had just chosen them in the source. Neither file can answer the questions the reports were
 * actually about:
 *
 *   - does every north-south run in the SHIPPED content actually get the corner treatment, or does
 *     some tier/merge/width condition silently disqualify most of it? (This repo has already
 *     shipped that exact bug once: `wallGeometry`'s old `w > h` guard left 1 wall standing where
 *     32 should, because level-1's rooms are almost entirely `w <= h`.)
 *   - do the pieces still tile the plane — no hole where a clip removed art nobody else draws, no
 *     wall announcing an edge in the middle of a continuous surface?
 *   - is the constant that places the clip line still true of the art it was measured from?
 *
 * So: real floors through the real pipeline (`placeAuthoredFloor` → `buildFloorGeometry` →
 * `wallTier` → `mergeWallRuns` → `wallJoins`, which is RoomBuilder's own sequence), assertions
 * about RELATIONSHIPS between blocks rather than restated coordinates, and one assertion that
 * reads actual PNG pixels. Every check here is mutation-verified — see the counts in
 * design/01-rendering.md's "a deep run TUCKS" entry.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: whether the result LOOKS right. That needs a live frame and a luma
 * sample; the numbers from those rounds live in design/01. These are the strongest checks that
 * survive in a canvas-free vitest run.
