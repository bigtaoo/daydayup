/**
 * The SHIPPED drop/portal art itself (`client/public/environment/pickup_*.png`,
 * `portal_arch.png`), decoded and measured (2026-08-20). Sibling of `pillarArt.test.ts`,
 * for the same reason: every other test in this directory checks what the renderer does
 * with a texture, and these objects' whole look now lives in the files.
 *
 * This batch's own history is why each assertion below exists. Nine generations went into
 * six shipped files, and every rejection was a property no test of the CODE could see:
 *
 * 1. **The heal drop came back as a wide-lidded jar** whose top fifth measured luma 50 —
 *    inside the ember floor's own 39-49 band, so at 18 px the lid read as a hole in the
 *    floor rather than as part of an object.
 * 2. **The buff sigil's inner arrow was an outline, not a solid** — 5.8% of the object's
 *    width per stroke, i.e. ONE pixel at display size. It measured fine as a shape and
 *    disappeared completely in game.
 * 3. **The bandage came back as a circular end-on roll** with two concentric rings and a
 *    dark centre: a pale disc with a dark middle, in a game where the hero, every critter
 *    and the boss are all single-eyed. Its silhouette is what fixes that, so its silhouette
 *    is what this file pins.
 *
 * Each rejected attempt is kept in `art/environment/*_alt.png`, and the last describe block
 * runs the same measurements over them — so an assertion that stops discriminating
 * accepted from rejected art fails here rather than passing vacuously.
 *
 * Reference values are the live in-frame measurements these were tuned against (extract of
 * the real level 1 at zoom 1): floor 39-49, wall face 27.3-27.5, wall cap 72-88.
