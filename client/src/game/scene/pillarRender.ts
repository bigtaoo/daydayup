 * auto-batch line, so each of the launch map's 124 pillars cost a draw call and a program
 * switch each way (245 of a 278-draw frame). `wallShadingSurfaces.drawBaseContactCrease` had
 * already been converted; `wallTone`'s `BASE_AO_BANDS` doc named this as the outstanding half
 * and flagged the catch, which is why this is two shapes rather than one:
 *
 *  1. the GRADIENT, over the base fraction of the room height down to the ground line. Full
 *     width and unrounded, because the pillar is full width here — the stepped version rounded
 *     every band, including the ones far up the shaft where nothing curves, which pinched the
 *     crease inward slightly at each one.
 *  2. the SKIRT below the ground line, which the stepped version carried as extra height on its
 *     last band at that band's held alpha. This is the piece that needs the shaft's corner
 *     rounding, because the foot is where the silhouette actually curves.
 *
 * Two shapes rather than one roundRect under one ramp for a reason worth keeping: `rampFill`
 * only guarantees no wrapping while the filled shape is a SUBSET of its own ramp segment (see
 * its doc), and a shape reaching past the ground line would sample beyond the last texel of a
 * ramp anchored at it — a `repeat` wrap back to alpha 0, i.e. a crease that fades out at the
 * foot. The alternative is a custom baked field that rises then HOLDS, which works but keys a
 * bake per distinct pillar height and stops sharing the wall's texture. Sharing wins: this is
 * the same `linearRamp()` every wall face samples, so "a pillar and a wall meet the floor the
 * same way" is now true of the texture and not just of the constants.

 * `height` are what `RoomBuilder` already computes.
 *
 * Hand-toned rather than textured, after three attempts (2026-08-18):
 *
 *   1. **The original was pale mauve.** Pillars were flat `Graphics` filled from
 *      `palette.pillar`/`palette.pillarTop`, which mix the biome's ELEMENT hue into a slate
 *      base — on ember that lands on `0x564850`. Those are code-only FALLBACK hues chosen
 *      before any real biome art existed, and every shipped swatch is charcoal-navy stone. Once
 *      the walls read as real stone, four pale-mauve cylinders read as placeholder props
 *      someone forgot to replace: the worst thing left in the frame.
 *   2. **Texturing them from the wall swatches was worse.** A pillar's cap is a ~35 px ellipse
 *      and its shaft ~80 px, so a `TilingSprite` window that small lands on one arbitrary dark
 *      patch of a 256 px swatch — no legible stone pattern, just a dark blob, and with the
 *      brick elevation on the shaft the whole thing read as an open-topped well.
 *   3. **Hand-toned shading, drawn as a real cylinder, is what works** — and needs no mask, no
 *      texture and no filter. This is that.
 *   4. **Real pillar art, generated for this object (2026-08-20), is what finally beats it** —
 *      `buildPillarSprite` above. Not a contradiction of ②: what failed there was sampling a
 *      256 px WALL swatch through a pillar-sized window, and what works is art authored at
 *      pillar scale. This function stays as the fallback for a missing texture, exactly like
