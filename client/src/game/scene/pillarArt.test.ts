/**
 * The SHIPPED pillar art itself (`client/public/biome/pillar_neutral.png`), decoded and measured
 * (2026-08-20). Every other test in this directory checks what the renderer does with a texture;
 * this one checks the texture, because the pillar's whole look now lives in the file and three of
 * the things that went wrong on the way here are invisible to any test of the code:
 *
 * 1. **The generation came back with a painted "transparency" checkerboard** — 3.46M opaque
 *    pixels, zero transparent ones, drawn to LOOK like an alpha channel. It had to be keyed out
 *    by hand. `alpha-audit.mjs` catches that repo-wide, but nothing stopped the file from being
 *    wired up before the audit ran.
 * 2. **The art's aspect ratio is what decides how tall a pillar stands** (`pillarSpriteMetrics`
 *    scales by width), so a regenerated file at a different aspect silently breaks the
 *    `WALL_HEIGHT` agreement every standing thing in a room shares (design/01).
 * 3. **Its tonal placement is the whole point of the pass.** The first accepted file measured a
 *    shaft twice as bright as the wall face beside it (lit limb 84 against a wall face's 31-41)
 *    while its top was already on target — the reason `tools/png-pipeline/lumaCurve.mjs` exists.
 *    Nothing but a measurement of the file can tell whether that step was run.
 *
 * The numbers below are the live in-frame measurements this pass was tuned against (extract of
 * the real level 1 gallery room at zoom 1, UI and actors hidden): pillar top 87.3, lit limb 50.4,
 * mid band 35.8, dark limb 16.7, against wall caps of 72-81 and wall faces of 27.3-27.5.
