// pass pushed the file past its recorded baseline. It is form (2) from CLAUDE.md, not form (3):
// the cross-boundary call list is exactly ONE method (`setSkinFilters`), which is why the host
// dependency is declared as a one-method interface rather than as the whole `Actor`.
//
// Everything here is presentation state with no engine meaning: `Actor` mirrors sim values into
// it (`setShield`, `setBurning`) and drives its clocks from the render frame (`tick`). Nothing in
