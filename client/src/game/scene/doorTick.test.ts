/**
 * `doorTick.ts` — which doors get a frame of motion, how near the player is to each, and whether
 * a locked one is currently refusing them.
 *
 * Three of these rules are the kind that go wrong silently. The CULL decides whether a per-frame
 * `Graphics` rebuild runs for 24 doors or for the 2 on screen, and a cull that lets everything
 * through looks identical in play. The PROXIMITY ramp measures to a door's footprint, not its
 * centre, which only shows up on the 128 px kerb doors — half the shipped ones. And the REFUSAL
 * has three conditions of which any two will fire on a player merely walking past a doorway, so
 * each one is asserted to be independently necessary rather than just asserting the happy path.
