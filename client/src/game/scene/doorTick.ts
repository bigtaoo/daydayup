 * - they are not actually moving (`REJECT_SPEED_PX` per frame). This is the condition that tells
 *   "walked into it and stopped" from "walking past it": the sim has already resolved the
 *   collision, so a blocked player's position simply stops changing, and that is the whole signal.
 *
 * `moveMag` is the command's own 0..255 stick deflection and `moveRad` its direction, so this is
