  // `SceneLightFilter` never shades it. That placement is the point: the 2026-08-27 frame that
  // closed the camera list found much of what read as "the void" was the light pass darkening what

  // camera like everything else in `world`, but must never be visually buried behind a standing
  // wall the occlusion x-ray only PARTIALLY fades (design/01 "Limits of fake 3D" — a health bar
  // is a HUD readout riding in world space, not a body part; it should never share the body's
  // "reads through translucent stone" treatment, which stays legible for a near-white body but
  // washes out the bar's own dark contour/track, live report *"血条被墙挡住了"*). Drawn last

  //  hudOverlay — the in-run HUD + touch controls (Game.buildHud's `hudView`). NOT the
  //    `hud` layer above: that one is world-space floating health bars, this one is
  //    fixed to the viewport. Stays UNSCALED — a thumbstick should be thumb-sized on a
  //    phone, not shrunk with the menus.
  //  menu — every full-screen menu/overlay + the forge's SETTINGS button. On its own
  //    container because that container carries a transform: MenuLayer.fit() scales it
  //    down on viewports shorter than the menus' design size (a WeChat landscape phone
  //    is 390 logical px tall — see ui/menuLayer.ts).
  //
  // Menus paint OVER the HUD (that is why the pause menu is legible mid-run), which is
  // the pre-split order: `Game.buildHud()` runs before the menu screens are added, so
  // `hudView` was always the lower of the two. Pinning it here as two named containers
  // makes that an invariant of the layer tree instead of an add-order accident.

  // progress screen the run gate puts up (`ui/loadingScreen.ts`, via
  // `controllers/ArtGate.ts`). It has to be its own layer for the same reason the split above
  // exists — a full-screen wait mounted into `menu` would paint UNDER whichever screen's own
  // full-viewport Panel was already up, which is exactly how the forge's SETTINGS button spent
  // months invisible. Unscaled like `hudOverlay`: a spinner is not menu content, and it must be
  // the same physical size on a 390 px-tall phone as on a desktop window.
  //
  // Empty in almost every frame of a session. While it is not, its spinner redraws each frame
  // and so invalidates `ui`'s render group — which is fine for the second or two a gate lasts,
  // and is why nothing here gets a render group of its own.

    // A Pixi v8 render group caches its instruction set — the flattened list of "add this
    // renderable to the batch, break here, draw this on its own" — and rebuilds it only when its
    // own contents change. Writing any descendant's `zIndex` invalidates it
    // (`sortMixin.depthOfChildModified` -> `structureDidChange`), and `entities` is a layer whose
    // whole purpose is that every actor writes a `zIndex` every frame. Before this split there was
    // ONE group for all of `root`, so those per-actor writes threw away the cached instructions for
    // the floor, the ground shadows, the health bars and the whole UI as well, and all of it was
    // re-collected 60 times a second: 168 Graphics re-added per frame, of which 54 belonged to
    // layers that had not changed since the room loaded.

    // The layers below either never change during a room (`ground`) or change only when an entity
    // spawns/dies (`shadow`, `hud`) or on a phase/resize (`ui`, `backdrop`) — all of which still
    // invalidate their own group correctly, just not once per frame. Measured on the level-1 start
    // room, 8 live enemies: 168 -> 114 re-adds, render collection 0.60 -> 0.52 ms, and it is what
    // makes `staticGraphics()` affordable on `ground`/`shadow` (see that module).
    //
    // NOT `entities` (rebuilt every frame by design — a group there would buy nothing and add a
    // batch boundary), NOT `fx` (particles are added and removed constantly, plus it carries a
    // blur filter), and NOT `lit`/`world` (they hold `entities`, so they inherit its churn).
