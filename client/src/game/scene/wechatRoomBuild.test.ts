/**
 * Building a room on a WeChat-SHAPED runtime — the regression net for the 2026-08-25 crash
 * where entering any map threw out of `RoomBuilder.build`:
 *
 *     Error: Could not find a source type for resource: [object HTMLCanvasElement]
 *         at ... a3.build ... v3.onRoomEnter
 *
 * The cause was `capLight.bakeLitCap` reaching for browser DOM directly: `document.createElement`
 * for the bake canvas and `Texture.from(canvas)` for the result. `Texture.from` identifies a canvas
 * by `resource instanceof HTMLCanvasElement || resource instanceof OffscreenCanvas`, and the
 * mini-game runtime defines NEITHER global — so the canvas matched no source class and Pixi threw,
 * taking the whole room build with it. Every other room test in this directory runs in an
 * environment that has no canvas at all, which takes `bakeLitCap`'s early-out and therefore could
 * not see this: the bug needed a runtime where a canvas EXISTS but is not a DOM one.
 *
 * So this file models exactly that, in the same spirit as `render/wechatAssetLoad.test.ts`: strip
 * the browser globals a mini-game does not have, install a WeChat-shaped `DOMAdapter` whose
 * `createCanvas` hands back a wx-style canvas object, and run the REAL `RoomBuilder.build()`.
 * Nothing about the room is faked beyond the swatch textures the biome loaders would return.
 *
 * Both host shapes are run, because they fail DIFFERENTLY and only one of them crashes:
 *   - the DevTools simulator leaves a `document` reachable, so the old code got a canvas out of it
 *     and then threw at `Texture.from` — the reported crash;
 *   - a real device has no `document`, so the old code took the "no canvas" early-out instead: no
 *     crash, and silently no bake — the wall cap paid two draws forever on the one target the bake
 *     was written for. A fix that only stopped the throw would leave that half standing.
 *
 * It cannot pin what a real base library does with the resulting texture on upload (design/04's
 * checklist still owns that); it pins that the room BUILDS, and that the baked cap really is the
 * adapter's canvas rather than a browser one.
