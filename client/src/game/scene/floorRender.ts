// New 2026-08-20 (the scene pass after walls/characters/doors): what makes one room's FLOOR
// different from another's. Sibling of `wallRender.ts`/`doorRender.ts`/`roomLight.ts` — free
// functions over rects, no scene state — and, like `Particles.ts` and `pillarRender.ts`, it adds
// no new art: everything here is the shipped swatch plus Graphics.
//
// **WHY.** Measured on a live full-floor extract of level 1 (`renderer.extract` over
// `layers.world`, luma 0-255): three 256x256 patches of open floor, 512 px apart, in three
// DIFFERENT rooms, came back with identical statistics (mean 38.6, sd 4.6, min 21, max 105) and
// only 2.9% of their bytes differing — and that 2.9% was `roomLight.ts`'s corner falloff, not the
// floor. The whole game was one `TilingSprite` of a 256 px swatch: an exact 8-grid-cell period,
// the same in every room, on every floor, with a swatch whose own contrast is sd 5.2. That is
// what makes five rooms read as one sheet with furniture standing on it, and it is the reason
// `roomLight.ts` had to exist at all — before it, nothing in the frame distinguished one room's
// ground from another's.
//
// Four layers, cheapest first, each one addressing a different scale of the problem:
//
//   0. **The floor stops at the rooms** (`stampFloor` takes a ROOM, and `RoomBuilder` calls it per
//      room). The old TilingSprite covered the world's BOUNDING BOX, which on a `graph2d` floor is
//      much bigger than the union of its rooms — 29-56% of the old floor across the five shipped
//      floors (`floorCoverage.test.ts`), on floor 0 one 1500x430 featureless field with no walls
//      and no room light in it. That single change does more for "five rooms, not one sheet" than
//      any decal.
//   1. **The stamp** (`stampFloor`) — one Sprite per tile instead of one TilingSprite, each
//      MIRRORED from a deterministic hash of its own grid position. Flips are the only transform
//      used, because a seamless tile stays seamless under a mirror (its left edge equals its right
//      edge by definition, so a mirrored copy still matches its neighbour) and does NOT under a 90°
//      rotation, whose edges come from the tile's other axis. This breaks the SHAPE repetition.
//   2. **Mottle** (`drawFloorMottle`) — soft blobs at 1.5-3 tile diameters, dark and light, so the
//      floor has AREAS. The eye reads large-scale value variation long before it reads a repeated
//      cobble, which is why this matters more than the stamp does.
//   3. **Per-room wash** (`drawRoomWash`) — one warm-or-cool multiply per room, chosen by a hash of
//      its index. Room identity, kept inside `13`'s "environment desaturated" band: the strongest
//      wash here moves the floor's mean by a few luma, not into a colour.
//   4. **Wear** (`drawFloorDecals`, `drawDoorWear`) — stains, rubble specks lit from the same
//      upper-left key light as everything else in the room, and a worn light patch across each
//      doorway along its travel axis. This is the layer that gives an empty 512x512 room anything
//      to look at.
//
// Determinism is by hash, never `Math.random` — same reason `Pickup`'s bob phase is a golden angle
// times its entity id (design/06's spirit applied to the render layer): two clients, and two
// visits to the same room, must draw the identical floor.
