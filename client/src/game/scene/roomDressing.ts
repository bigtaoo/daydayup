// Split out of RoomBuilder 2026-08-27 (500-line convention, CLAUDE.md form ① — a set of
// independent functions with no shared private state, the same form `groundLayer.ts` took out of
// the same file in 2026-08-20): the two kinds of free-standing thing a room is DRESSED with, as
// opposed to the geometry it is BUILT from.
//
// The distinction is not cosmetic. Walls and doors are the room's shape — they come out of
// merged runs, they carve each other, they share one shadow Graphics, and a door's fixture has to
// know which wall run it was cut into. A pillar or a prop is placed at a point, on its own, from
// one engine record, and nothing else in the room depends on where it landed. That is why these
// two moved and the wall/door pass did not: each is a loop over engine records that reads
// `layers` and returns what it made, so RoomBuilder keeps only the lists (it owns their
// lifetimes — both kinds live on the Y-sorted `entities` layer, which `build()`/`clear()` never
// sweep wholesale) and calls two functions.

/** Destroy every Entity in `list` and empty the list in place.

 *  The shadow is NOT destroyed here, and that is the correction rather than an omission: all three
 *  copies of this loop that RoomBuilder used to carry called `e.shadow?.destroy()` before
 *  `e.destroy()`, and `Entity.destroy` already un-parents and destroys its own shadow — the wall
 *  path has always relied on exactly that and never had the extra line. A 2026-08-27 battery
 *  proved it: deleting the manual destroy left all 3,365 client tests green INCLUDING
 *  `RoomBuilder.test.ts`'s "clear() removes every pillar and its shadow", which asserts
 *  `layers.shadow.children.length === 0`. That test is the oracle, not an argument — so the line
 *  was two guards for one case, and this doc comment used to claim a leak that cannot happen. */
