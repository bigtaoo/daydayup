 *  faint rings is the same trick at a step size small enough to disappear.
 *
 *  Retuned again 2026-08-19 (measured pass) for the enemy shadows, which read as black
 *  DINNER PLATES the crystals sat in: 12 rings over a narrower 1.3..0.3 span, and the alpha
 *  RAMPED across the rings instead of held flat, so the outer edge (`SHADOW_ALPHA_OUTER`) is
 *  nearly invisible while the contact core still lands around 0.48. A flat per-ring alpha
 *  makes the outermost ring itself a visible hard edge, which is most of what made a shadow
 *  read as a disc rather than as a penumbra — the other half was its SIZE, see `makeShadow`. */
