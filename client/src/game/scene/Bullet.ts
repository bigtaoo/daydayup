// Per-element polish (design/03/07): an elemental bullet is drawn in its element
// hue with a soft additive glow halo, so a fire/ice/lightning/poison shot reads at a
// glance — distinct from a plain (faction-coloured) physical round. The world-space
// motion trail is spawned by Game (fx layer), keyed off the same element colour.

 *
 * Was a fixed 120ms budget until 2026-08-30 (user report *"子弹的弹道，现在会从枪口曲线跑到角色
 * 身前再继续飞向目标"*): at the ~10 grid/s (320 world px/s) most weapons fire, 120ms covers
 * ~38 world px, which read fine — but a slow weapon like frostbrand (`bulletSpeed: 6`, 192
 * world px/s) only covers ~23 px in the same 120ms, so the ~12-14 px offset measured on real
 * shots (the commit that introduced this correction, "most of a body radius") ate over half of
 * its early flight instead of a third. A slow bullet lingered right in front of the shooter
 * while the offset drained, which read as the shot curving there before straightening out
 * toward the target, rather than as leaving the barrel cleanly.
 *
 * Budgeting by distance travelled instead keeps the correction's visual footprint (offset px
 * over budget px) the same fraction of early flight for every `bulletSpeed` — a slow bullet
 * just takes longer, in ms, to cover the same 40 px, instead of spending its whole time budget
 * over a shorter distance.

   *
   * A decaying offset rather than just a different starting point, because the two lines are
   * PARALLEL, not merely offset at their origins: the sim places its muzzle `muzzleOffset`
   * along the aim ray, and the rig's own reach out to the barrel tip is a different distance
   * (`muzzleParity`'s table: +9.5 px for the blaster, up to +19.5 across the roster). A round
   * that merely STARTED at the barrel tip would run permanently ahead of its true position by
   * that much. Easing it out instead lets the shot leave the barrel and rejoin its own
   * position within the first `MUZZLE_EASE_DISTANCE_PX` of flight.
   *
   * That gap is a distance along the SHOT, so spending it only ever changes how fast the round
   * appears to travel — it can never bend the path. Both other axes on which the drawn gun and
   * the sim's spawn point used to disagree are now removed at the source rather than eased
   * away here, because easing them was the arc: the SIDEWAYS one by making the module orbit to
   * the aim (`rigWeaponMount`'s GROUND-PLANE ORBIT), the HEIGHT one by `setDrawnHeight` below.
   * The projection in this method is the backstop that keeps it that way.
   *
   * The shadow is deliberately left on the un-offset ground point: it marks where the
   * bullet actually is in the world, which is the sim position, not the drawn one.
