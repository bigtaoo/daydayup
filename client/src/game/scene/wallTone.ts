/**
 * **The tonal hierarchy, and the one thing in this pass worth getting right.**
 *
 * Measured off a live frame of the shipped floor on 2026-08-19 (luma 0-255, from a full-floor
 * `renderer.extract` so the camera cannot skew it), the room read like this:
 *
 * | surface                    | was | target |
 * |----------------------------|-----|--------|
 * | pillar top                 | 105 |     90 |
 * | **floor**                  |  53 |     53 |
 * | wall cap (east-west run)   |  44 |     90 |
 * | wall cap (north-south run) |  33 |     90 |
 * | wall face, upper           |  23 |     36 |
 * | wall face, at the base     |  14 |     17 |
 *
 * A top surface raised 104 px above the ground was DARKER THAN THE GROUND it stands on. That
 * single inversion is the physical cause of the user's *"就像一张图贴在地上"*: the most basic
 * reading anyone has for height — higher surfaces catch more light — was running backwards, and
 * no amount of silhouette, side band or cast shadow can outvote it. It also explains why a
 * north-south run was the worst case of all: 100% of what you see of one IS its cap (its face
 * only shows at the run's south end), so such a run was a floor-value ribbon lying on a
 * floor-value floor.
 *
 * The previous tuning got there honestly, for a reason that measurement removed. It was written
 * against the belief that `wall_<element>.png` is "a LIGHT grey stone" and the face swatch dark
 * charcoal, so all of its work went into separating the two from EACH OTHER — cap 0.95, face
 * pulled hard down to 0.5. In fact the two swatches have almost the same own-value (~46), and
 * the pair was being separated around the wrong midpoint: correct relative to one another, both
 * far too dark relative to the floor.
 *
 * Pixi tints only MULTIPLY, so a cap cannot be lifted above its swatch's own value by tinting
 * at all. `CAP_LIGHT` is an additive key light over the cap that does it instead — see its own
 * doc below for why additive rather than a translucent wash.

 * toward white, so it also compresses the swatch's own contrast by 21% — and a wall cap is
 * nothing BUT stone detail at that scale, so the cap came out as smooth brushed concrete. An
 * additive term adds the same constant to every pixel instead, lifting the surface while keeping
 * the mortar-to-stone amplitude intact. Warm, because the key light is warm (`NormalLitFilter`'s

 *
 * A FLAT additive constant hits the target luma and destroys the stone anyway, because contrast
 * is perceived as a RATIO, not as a difference. The swatch's stone-to-mortar range is about
 * 30..60, i.e. 2:1; adding a constant 47 to both ends gives 77..107, which is 1.4:1. The
 * amplitude the previous doc set out to protect survives in absolute terms and the *look* does
 * not: at play scale the cap became featureless pale concrete. On an east-west wall the cap is a
 * 32 px band under a lit coping and nobody notices; on a north-south run the cap is 100% of what
 * you see of the wall (224 px deep on level 1's shortest one), so the whole wall read as a pale
 * concrete beam laid across the floor.
 *
 * The fix is to lift the cap MULTIPLICATIVELY, which Pixi cannot do with a tint (tints only
 * multiply *down*) but can do by drawing the cap swatch A SECOND TIME in `add` mode: the result
 * is `value × (1 + alpha)`, so 30..60 becomes 59..117 — the same target value with the 2:1
 * ratio intact. `CAP_BOOST_TINT` carries the key light's warmth on that second copy instead of a
 * separate wash, so the top is still warm against a cool floor for one draw call, not two.
 *
 * Measured on the shipped floor after the change: north-south cap 80, east-west cap 72, floor 45,

 * corner treatment exists to prevent, shipped invisibly on two biomes out of four.
 *
 * Row-luma scans behind the numbers (256-wide swatches, mean per row):
 *   - fire 127 rows: coping 0-20 at 97-173, mortar 21-30 (76 -> 7 -> 22), brick 31+ at ~50
 *   - ice 125 rows: coping 0-13 at 75-186, mortar 14-19 (58 -> 10 -> 25), brick 20+ at ~44
 *   - lightning 127 rows: coping 0-24 at 62-180, mortar 25-30 (51 -> 22 -> 37), brick 31+ at ~48
 *   - neutral 125 rows: coping 0-22 at 62-142, mortar 23-29 (51 -> 15 -> 35), brick 31+ at ~52

 * **Where the band counts went (2026-08-24).**
 *

 * case: at the 5 bands the side band uses, the step across it is 0.11, and because the coping is
 * the BRIGHTEST thing on the face that showed as five hard horizontal stripes in a 3x render —
 * the loudest artifact the correction's first version introduced. 18 took the step to 0.03, i.e.
 * ~5/255 on a coping that bright. The rule was: the count follows from the largest step the eye
 * may not see, and the brighter the surface underneath, the more bands it needs.
 *
 * The ramps are now SAMPLED from a shared texture rather than stepped (`render/shadeRamp.ts`),
 * so there is no step to hide and no per-surface count to tune: `RAMP_TEXELS` puts the largest
 * step below 1/255 for every profile here at once, and the GPU's linear filter makes the result
 * continuous rather than merely finely stepped. `BASE_AO_BANDS` was the one survivor, because
 * `pillarRender` still stepped its own copy of that crease; it was converted 2026-08-26 and the
 * constant is gone, so nothing in this renderer hand-steps a gradient any more.
 *
 * Kept as a comment rather than deleted because it is the reasoning, not the number, that a
 * future ramp needs — and because it names the failure mode (banding on a bright surface) that
 * would come back the moment someone hand-steps a gradient here again.
