// These are the STILL layers — each is drawn once when a door is built and then only toggled by

 * The recess behind the leaf — what makes a doorway a hole rather than a panel.
 *
 * Bands from the top of the opening downward, so the passage is darkest where it is deepest. It
 * matters most for an OPEN door, whose art is a frame around a transparent middle: with no recess
 * you see the room's floor tiling straight through the arch and the wall stops reading as solid.
 *
 * It darkens the wall's own elevation swatch rather than replacing it (`addWallFace` runs first
 * over the whole face) — the first version filled the opening with flat near-black and, on a
 * 22 px kerb door where the leaf art crops to almost nothing, that was the entire fixture: a
 * black rectangle punched in the room. Stone in deep shade reads as a passage; a void reads as a
 * rendering bug. Hence also the ceiling on the top band's alpha.

 *
 * **Why this exists (2026-08-30, second pass the same day as the through/spill/rim lighting

 * `drawRecess`'s default alphas darken the SAME wall-stone elevation for both states, so a
 * passable door and a locked one differ only in how much light is added on top of an otherwise
 * identical dark tunnel. Live report, after the lighting pass had already shipped: *"可以通过时的门，
 * 好了一些，但离我想要的效果还差很远"* (better, but still far from the effect wanted) — circling the
 * opening itself, not the light. The tunnel needs to say "floor" before the light says "lit".
 *
 * Numbers are far lighter than the locked pair: the floor swatch is what has to read, and the
 * locked alphas (0.72/0.34) would bury it under almost the same near-black wash the flat colour
 * used to be. Kept as bands rather than one flat alpha for the same reason as every other ramp in

/**
 * A passable door's light from beyond — the open state's mirror of the hazard bloom above.
 *
 * **WHY.** Before this, "open" was defined only by SUBTRACTION: the locked state minus the red
 * pool, minus the hazard leaf. Everything with a positive signal in it was `visible = locked`, so
 * a passable door said "walk through me" by the ABSENCE of a cue — and what was left measured as
 * the darkest thing around: the arch's interior at luma 19 against a 37 floor (design/01), framed
 * by stone the same value as the wall it is cut into, sitting in the darkest band `roomLight`
 * paints (its falloff darkens toward a room's edge, and a door is always on one). A black
 * rectangle in a stone frame is what a WALL looks like. Live report, with a screenshot circling
 * one: the locked state reads well, but *"when it is passable it looks like a black wall — it is
 * hard to tell at once that this is a door you can walk through"*.
 *
 * **The cue is light, not a second saturated colour.** design/13 is "environment desaturated,
 * hazards saturated": a locked door is allowed to shout because "you cannot leave yet" is urgent,
 * a doorway is not. The passage leads to a lit room, so light comes OUT of it — one physical
 * claim, three pieces:
 *
 *   through — the passage's own floor, lit from beyond, ramped up from the threshold. Drawn
 *             BEHIND the leaf so the arch art's own stone masks it: the light shows through the
 *             transparent middle and nowhere else, with no inset constant keyed to where a
 *             particular PNG's jambs happen to sit. It is the exact inverse of `drawRecess`'s
 *             ramp, which stays — the recess is what makes the opening a hole, this is what puts
 *             a lit floor at the bottom of it.
 *   spill   — a pool on the room floor south of the threshold: the same nine graduated rings as
 *             `GLOW_POOL`, warm white, at two thirds the alpha. Deliberately the same SHAPE as the
 *             hazard pool so "a pool at the door" is ONE symbol the player learns once, with
 *             colour saying which state. This is also the piece that carries a KERB door, where a
 *             22 px opening leaves no room for the ramp above — 11 of the 24 shipped doors.
 *   rim     — the aperture's edge catching that light on its way out: warm bands up both jambs,
 *             brightest at the threshold, dying out going up. What stops the arch from reading as
 *             flush with the flat wall beside it. NOT across the lintel's underside: the top of
 *             the opening is where the recess is deliberately darkest, and a lit line up there
 *             would flatten the one depth cue the recess exists for.

 * the mottle bands): a single alpha draws its own hard edge and reads as a painted panel.
 *
 * Both numbers were swept on a live frame of level 1's 64x92 perimeter door rather than reasoned
 * about, and the sweep is the argument for them. Reach 0.45 lit only the sill and left the fixture

 * crown, which design/01 calls what the eye reads a back wall by. 0.22 clears the near floor by
