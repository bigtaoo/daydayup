/**
 * Does the STANDING door fixture (2026-08-20, `doorRender.ts`) actually work on the shipped
 * content — and does every door really present the SAME way?
 *
 * **What this file used to hold, and why it changed (2026-09-03).** Until this pass a door
 * inherited the height of the shortest wall abutting its passage (`doorFlankTier`), and this
 * sweep's job was to prove that rule fired on real content. It did, and the measurement it
 * printed is what condemned the rule: 24 doors across the five shipped floors, 13 standing at
 * `WALL_H_PERIMETER` (a 64x128 passage through a room boundary, travel east-west) and 11 at
 * `WALL_H_KERB` — a 128x64 passage through the low boundary between two vertically stacked
 * rooms, drawn as a 128 x **22** letterbox under 64 px of its own cap stone, showing 12% of its
 * own leaf art. Nearly half the doors in the game were a fixture whose own lintel was three times
 * its opening. Live report
 * with a screenshot of one: *"有些门会被墙盖住... 我希望门的表现是单独的，统一的，不管墙有多厚"*.
 * So the height is now one constant, `wallGeometry.DOOR_H`, for every door — see there for what
 * that spends against the clearance rule `WALL_H_KERB` exists for.
 *
 * The sweep itself stays, because the risk it was written against is unchanged and this repo has
 * shipped it once already (`wallGeometry`'s old `w > h` guard left 1 wall standing where 32
 * should): a geometric claim that reads correctly, passes on hand-built fixtures, and matches
 * nothing in the real level. So this runs the REAL five shipped floors through the REAL pipeline
 * (`placeAuthoredFloor` → `buildFloorGeometry` → `wallTier` → `mergeWallRuns` → the doors' own
 * `wallJoins` pass, RoomBuilder's own sequence) and asserts that BOTH passage shapes still occur
 * — the uniformity claim is empty if the content only ever produces one of them.
