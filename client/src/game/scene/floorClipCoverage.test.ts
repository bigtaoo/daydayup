/**
 * The room clip (`floorClip.ts`, 2026-08-27), swept over the maps the game actually builds.
 *
 * **WHAT THE CLIP IS FOR.** `drawFloorMottle` centres blobs inside a room and draws them up to 460
 * world px across, so before this pass every room painted ~42% of its ink OUTSIDE itself, four dark
 * and four light halves were legitimately on screen where one room was visible, and the three
 * neighbours painted 1.31 + 1.91 extra viewports of pure spill. Measured on a real GPU, three
 * counterbalanced sessions with twin controls: the clip is worth **0.53-0.93 ms** of a ~4.4 ms arena
 * frame, and takes the visible ground pieces from 13 to 7 (`perf/README.md`'s seventh measurement).
 *
 * **WHY THE PROPERTIES BELOW ARE THE ONES WORTH ASSERTING.** A clip is easy to make fast and easy to
 * make ugly: truncating a smooth field leaves a step of the field's own local value, and a straight
 * step on a floor is exactly what `floorRender`'s header rejected the per-tile tint for. Measured
 * offline before the shape was chosen, a HARD clip at the room rect would leave a **29.98 luma** step
 * across a doorway (median 7.24) on a floor whose base is 25.9. So the clip ramps, and this file
 * asserts the three things that make that safe, each swept over real content:
 *
 *   1. **Where the cut is allowed to land is stone.** Every shipped room rect includes its own
 *      perimeter wall exactly one grid cell deep. Measured here, not assumed.
 *   2. **The cut ramps inside that cell**, faintest band at the room's edge and strongest a full cell
 *      in, so the largest step any one cut can make is one band's own alpha — a step that band's rim
 *      already makes in the shipped art.
 *   3. **Nothing paints outside its room any more**, which is what lets `groundCulling.ts` drop a
 *      neighbour's halves while staying an exact intersection.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: what it looks like. That was checked in a live frame — worst per-pixel luma
 * step inside all 74 passage floors went from 36.16 to 18.51 (median 24.23 to 14.65), i.e. the
 * clipped doorway is SMOOTHER than the unclipped one, and the ramp sits under the floor swatch's own
 * texel-to-texel variation. `perf/README.md` has that reading and the three frame readers that
 * failed their own controls before it.
