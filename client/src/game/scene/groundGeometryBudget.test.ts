/**
 * The ground stage's BATCH-POLICY ENVELOPE and its CULL, over real shipped maps.
 *
 * ## What this file was, and what changed on 2026-08-26
 *
 * `buildGroundLayer` mounts its overlay passes with `staticGraphics()`, which forces
 * `batchMode: 'batch'` and so overrides Pixi's 400-float auto-batch cutoff unconditionally. That
 * override is a *measured* trade, and `render/staticGraphics.ts`'s header states the content it was
 * measured on: **"a room's shared wall-shadow Graphics is ~24k floats, the floor's decal pass
 * ~50k"**, where forcing `batch` on `layers.ground`/`layers.shadow` bought -24 draw calls for
 * -0.08 ms.
 *
 * Nothing checked that the content stayed inside that envelope, and it had not. `arena_launch`
 * accumulated its per-room wash/mottle/decals into TWO whole-map `Graphics` of 284,966 and 265,566
 * floats, batched and submitted every frame however far away the camera was, on a layer measured at
 * **2.05 ms of a 4.3 ms arena GPU frame**. This file's first version gated that as a per-Graphics
 * budget with `arena_launch` pinned as a known-over-budget exemption.
 *
 * The change was not to draw less. It was to make what is drawn CULLABLE: the layer is now one piece
 * per room (per region, per door), each tagged with the rect it paints, and `groundCulling.ts`
 * switches the off-screen ones off once per frame from `FxController.updateCamera`. The geometry is
 * unchanged to the float — the sums below reproduce the pre-split browser census exactly — so the
 * exemption is gone not because the content shrank but because no single piece is large any more.
 *
 * What that did and did not buy is recorded in `groundCulling.ts` and `perf/README.md`, and it is
 * not what the first version of this file predicted: the batcher packs 17x less vertex data, and the
 * GPU frame did not measurably move. So the bounds below are bounds on GEOMETRY, which is what they
 * always measured; none of them is evidence about milliseconds.
 *
 * ## The three bounds here, deliberately of different kinds
 *
 *  1. **A per-ROOM rate** (portable). These passes are painted per room, so the layer's total is
 *     `rooms x rate`. The rate is the part a 3-room dev fixture can still falsify, which makes it
 *     the bound that would have caught the original defect at authoring time.
 *  2. **A per-PIECE ceiling** (what the batch policy is about). Every mounted piece must stay inside
 *     the envelope `staticGraphics()` was measured on. Its control is that the map's TOTAL is still
 *     an order of magnitude past that ceiling — the per-piece pass must not be able to come from the
 *     content having got smaller.
 *  3. **What the CAMERA submits** (the property the fix created, and the one with no other reader).
 *     Swept over every room of every catalog map, through the real `FxController.updateCamera`. A
 *     regression that silently un-tagged the pieces, or mounted them as one Graphics again, leaves
 *     bounds (1) and (2) untouched and fails only here.
 *
 * Scope, stated rather than implied: the harness in the first half hands `buildGroundLayer` no
 * `wallRects`. Omitting them can only ADD floats (they suppress rubble — see `groundLayer.test.ts`'s
 * "keeps rubble off the wall footprints"), so those totals are an upper bound on the shipped one,
 * which is the safe direction for a budget. The second half drives the real `RoomBuilder`.
