// Split out of Game.ts, 2026-09-03 — the PURE half of the run: every piece of mutable
// state the shell's controllers read and write, and nothing that draws.
//
// ## Why this exists rather than another controller
//
// CLAUDE.md's split order asks for independent functions first, composition second, and an
// inheritance chain only as a last resort. Game.ts fits none of those on its own, and the
// reason is visible the moment you try: `beginRun`, `showForge`, `quitRun`,
// `finalizeOnlineRun` and `confirm` all read and write the SAME dozen fields — `phase`,
// `meta`, `online`, `tutorialActive`, `engine`, `session`, `score`. Cut the file along any
// behavioural seam and the two halves call each other, which CLAUDE.md names outright as a
// sign the boundary is drawn wrong, with the prescribed answer being "extract a shared lower
// layer both depend on". This is that layer.
//
// So the shape is: `RunState` owns the data, the controllers own the behaviour, and Game.ts
// owns the Pixi objects and the wiring between them. A controller never reaches into another
// controller for state — it reads it here.
//
// ## What it buys, concretely
//
// This file imports no `pixi.js`, touches no DOM global, and constructs nothing that needs a
// renderer. That is what makes `runState.test.ts` able to assert the rules that used to be
// unreachable without a browser: that quitting a run clears the online flag (a real
// pre-existing bug, recorded in `quitRun`'s own comment), that the tutorial flag is one-way
// per run, that `activeState` reads the session online and the engine offline. Before the
// split those rules lived in a class whose constructor needs an `Application`.
//
// `src/game/pureLayerBoundary.test.ts` is what keeps it that way; the 90% coverage gate
// cannot (see that file's header for why a percentage can never guard a boundary).
