 * The checkpoint overlay pass, split out of `GameLoop.updateHud` (CLAUDE.md 500-line

 * a floor is finished, driven from one shared condition.
 *
 * That sharing is the reason it is one function rather than three calls sitting next to
 * each other. Four things read "this floor is done": the portal's own open/closed
 * visual, the portal popup's proximity gate, the floor-card offer, and the fire
 * suppression that keeps a tap on either panel from also firing a shot. Computing the
 * condition once, here, is what makes it impossible for them to disagree — a card offer
 * over an unfinished floor, or a portal with no card to pick at it.
