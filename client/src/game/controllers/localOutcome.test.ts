/**
 * `localSeatWon` (design/11 + design/15) — the one question the result SCREEN and the `win`
 * audio CUE both have to answer, split out of `RunOutcome` 2026-09-02 so they cannot answer
 * differently.
 *
 * Two describes, and the second is the point of the file. The first pins the function's own
 * edges — the ones neither caller reaches, and the ones a plausible simplification breaks.
 * The second drives the same `(state, winner)` through BOTH real callers and asserts they
 * agree, which is the property that made the split worth doing: re-inlining a divergent
 * condition into either one compiles, and every other test in the repo stays green.
 *
 * Fixtures come from the engine's real `createGameState` (same convention as
 * `RunOutcome.test.ts`), because the whole question turns on two fields a cast object literal
 * would let you spell wrong: `zoneEnabled` (which win model applies) and per-seat `teamId`.
