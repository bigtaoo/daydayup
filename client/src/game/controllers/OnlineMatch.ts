// Split out of Game.ts, 2026-09-03 — the network glue: which mode to queue for, the connect
// function the Matchmaking screen drives, what a cancel or a lost connection does, and the
// account re-sync a login triggers.
//
// It is the thinnest of the three controllers on purpose. `onlineConnect.ts` already owns
// the actual matchmaking protocol (poll `/find`, redeem the ticket, open the socket) and
// `RunLifecycle.finalizeOnlineRun` owns what happens once a session exists. What lives here
// is the part that was stranded in the shell between them: the four fields a queue entry
// sets (`online` / `pvp` / `pvpSeats` / `partyId`), and the three failure paths.
//
// The failure paths are the reason this is worth its own file rather than a few more methods
// on the shell. `onMatchmakingCancelled` and `onOnlineConnectionLost` both have to leave the
// run state consistent for whatever the player does NEXT — a cancel that forgets to clear
// `online` leaves the next offline run reading a closed session, which is the exact bug
// `RunState.endRun` records for the quit path. They are now assertable without a renderer.
