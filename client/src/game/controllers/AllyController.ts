// A deterministic ally for local co-op (ROADMAP 3.1 — making the SECOND player visible
// and live). It produces a normal PlayerCommand for a non-local seat each sim tick, so
// the engine treats the ally exactly like a networked teammate: the command goes through
// the same input-edge quantization (quantizeMove → integer brad/mag) and the same
// ApplyInputSystem path. Nothing here decides outcomes — it only decides an INPUT, which
// the deterministic engine then simulates (design/08 "render only produces input").
//
// Behaviour: engage the nearest enemy (fire in range, hold spacing — facing is engine-
// decided, design/10 v33), and when the floor is quiet, regroup toward the local player
// so the two stay together through room transitions. All from the engine's fp state, no
// wall-clock / RNG — a bot is just another command source, and keeping it state-derived
// makes the run reproducible.
