// The purchase flow: list → order → pay → poll → re-read what the server says you own.
//
// Split from `StoreScreen` for the reason every other controller here is split from its
// screen (CLAUDE.md form ②): the branches worth testing are all in this half, and this half
// constructs nothing that needs a renderer. Every dependency is injected — the three wire
// calls, the session, the platform gate, the ownership refresh and even `sleep` — so the
// timed-out, failed, delivered and refresh-failed arms are all reachable from a plain test
// with no network, no clock and no Pixi.
//
// ## What replaced what
//
// `ForgeActions.acquireBlueprint` used to hand the player the first purchasable blueprint
// for free and call it a store (ROADMAP 2.4's `demo: free grant` scaffold). Since the server
// began answering `/account/meta` from its own `entitlements` table (design/19 §2), that
// grant does not survive the next login: the client granted it to itself, so the server has
// never heard of it. This is the real thing in its place.
//
// ## The two refusals that are not errors
//
// A store that lies is worse than a store that is closed, so both of these are reported as
// their own outcome and neither is dressed up as success:
//
//   - `not-configured` — the order was BOOKED and the platform cannot take money for it
//     (`server/src/billsvc/paymentParams.ts` explains at length why it says so honestly
//     rather than returning an unsigned block that would fail inside the SDK). Nothing is
//     polled: there is no payment to wait for. The booked order is simply left open; there
//     is no cancel route in the wire protocol, an unpaid order settles nothing, and design/19
//     §7's reconciliation sweep is what sees it.
//   - `timed-out` — the poll budget ran out with the order still `created`. That is NOT
//     "the purchase failed": a slow platform callback can still settle it minutes later, and
//     the next login re-reads entitlements anyway. The copy has to say so.
