/**
 * The run-boundary art gate (design/12) — its two load-bearing properties and the wiring that
 * uses them.
 *
 * Driven against the REAL `render/preloadArt.ts` module state rather than a mocked one, because
 * both properties this file is about are properties of that state: "inert until something
 * deferred" is `deferred === false`, and "synchronous when the art is in" is a promise that has
 * already resolved. A mock of `isRunArtReady` would let either one be wrong here and right
 * nowhere.
 *
 * The Pixi collaborators ARE faked (a Container and a Ticker are all this needs), same
 * convention as controllers/GameLoop.test.ts.
