  // `WeChatAudio` registers none of the window listeners `WebAudio` uses to clear the

  // to be handed the device by `Game.ts`, and that file's length is pinned by the drift gate.

  // 4.00 MB ceiling), and everything else arrives while the menu is up. `Game.artGate` awaits it

  // which is exactly the fallback funny's original was built around.
  // Each closed window also feeds the quality watchdog (render/qualityWatchdog.ts). This
  // runtime is the reason that path exists at all: every perf number in design/01 was measured
