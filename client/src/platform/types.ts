  // response to the player's finger rather than to a simulated event. They reach the bus
  // through `audio/uiSound.ts`, never through EventReactor.
  //
  // Four, not one, because they answer four different questions the player is asking:

// `assetPacks.json` already applies to art: do not pay bytes for content a run cannot reach.
