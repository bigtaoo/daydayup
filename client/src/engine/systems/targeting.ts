/**
 * Hostile-target pooling (design/15 — the PvP team/hostility model, ROADMAP
 * 4.2a). Every combat system used to pick "the opposite array" via a hardcoded
 * `faction === 'player' ? state.enemies : state.players` ternary — an
 * assumption baked in that there are only ever two sides. That breaks the
 * moment two players can be on different teams (PvP) or the same team
 * (squads): the correct question was never "which array," it's "who is
 * hostile to me," which spans both arrays and can exclude members of either.
 *
 * `hostileTargets`/`nearestHostile` are the shared replacement, used by
 * HitResolveSystem, DeflectSystem, ProjectileStepSystem, and combat.ts.
 * Iteration is players-then-enemies, matching every other array-order-is-the-
 * tiebreak convention in the engine (design/06) — deterministic regardless of
 * how many teams are actually in play.

 * Per-tick cache of "which players/enemies are on a team hostile to teamId T"
 * (perf: `hostileTargets` used to be called once per LIVE PROJECTILE — 50-150+
 * times/tick in a busy PvP arena — each rescanning every player+enemy through
 * `isHostile`, almost always recomputing the identical set). Team membership
 * (`teamId`) never changes mid-match, so this is safe to cache per team, but
 * ALIVE STATE does change mid-tick (an earlier bullet this same tick can kill an
 * actor a later bullet would otherwise still try to hit) — so only the team-
 * hostility partition is cached; `.alive`/`isDowned` are re-checked fresh on
 * every call below, exactly as before caching. Keyed by the GameState object
 * itself (WeakMap, not a module-level singleton) so multiple concurrent engine
 * instances (e.g. the PvP balance sim's bot-vs-bot loop) never cross-contaminate.
