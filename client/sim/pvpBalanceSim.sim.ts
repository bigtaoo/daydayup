/**
 * Headless bot-vs-bot PvP balance data (ROADMAP 4.x — `PVP_SCALE_FACTOR`
 * (balance/build.ts) and the zone shrink-step tuning (content/arenas.ts) are both
 * explicitly flagged "first-pass, real play required"). Real human playtesting is
 * the actual ground truth this feeds; this sim's job is a cheap, repeatable
 * FIRST SIGNAL — win-rate skew, whether matches converge, how long they run — that
 * doesn't need to wait for a human play session, and can be re-run after any tuning
 * change to see the direction it moved.
 *
 * Drives the engine directly (`createGameEngine` + `PvpBotController.build()` each
 * tick) rather than through MatchRoom/CoopSession/a real socket — this is a
 * gameplay-outcome question, not a net-layer one, and `buildPvpEngineConfig` is the
 * SAME function `Game.buildOnlineConfig`/`server/src/BotClient.ts` use for a real
 * match, so the simulated config is byte-identical to a real arena run (design/06
 * anti-drift — no hand-mirrored second copy of the config logic).

// config, then shuffling ONLY here which skinId lands on which seat (a distinct Prng
// stream, seeded off the match seed but never touching a gameplay stream — same
// isolation rule design/15's `integrityPrng` uses) breaks that correlation: over many
// seeds, every character lands on every seat/spawn roughly equally, so a persistent
