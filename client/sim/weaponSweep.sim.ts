/**
 * Per-weapon PvE sweep — the whole roster played through the shipped level, one weapon at
 * a time. Run it with:
 *
 *     npm run test:weapon-sim            (repo root, or -w client)
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The two existing balance sims never touched the weapon roster. `pvpBalanceSim.sim.ts`
 * measures character win-rate; `pveLevelSim.sim.ts` plays level 1 with the STARTER loadout
 * only (`blaster` + `saber`, i.e. `RunOptions.loadout: []`). Counted on 2026-09-04: the
 * other 22 player-facing weapons had never appeared in ANY simulation. The `loadout` hook
 * that makes this possible had been on `RunOptions` the whole time and was never swept.
 *
 * It is also the empirical half of a gap `engine/balance/weaponBalance.test.ts` states and
 * cannot close: **a static profile cannot price a mechanic.** Homing, a blast radius, a
 * hitscan beam, a bounce, a chill — the authored numbers say nothing about what each is
 * worth. This sim answers that question the only way it can be answered, by playing the
 * weapon and counting what it kills.
 *
 * ## The standoff problem, and why the bot is re-tuned per weapon
 *
 * Two false readings had to be designed out before any number here meant anything, and both
 * were the HARNESS's fault, not the weapons'. `BOT_PROFILES.careful` holds a 7.5-grid
 * standoff and opens fire at 11 grid, tuned for the starter pistol whose bullets reach 30.
 *
 *   1. REACH. The first cut reported ZERO kills for `lasercutter`, `gyre` and all seven
 *      blades. A lasercutter's beam is 3.5 grid long, a gyre blade circles at 1.6, a hammer
 *      reaches 1.3 — the bot stood outside its own weapon's range and fired into empty
 *      floor for the whole run.
 *   2. FLIGHT TIME. Capping the standoff by reach alone still left `mortar` scoring zero on
 *      four of eight seeds, and that looked like a weapon finding until it was measured:
 *      sweeping mortar's standoff from 9 grid down to 2 takes it from 11 kills (three seeds
 *      at zero) to 35 kills with 4-5 on EVERY seed. Nothing about the weapon changed. The
 *      bot does not lead its shots, so an 8 grid/s shell with a 1-second flight lands where
 *      the target used to be, and a 1.3-grid blast does not forgive that. Reach said 8 grid
 *      was fine; flight time said it was not.
 *
 * So the standoff is capped by BOTH (`profileForWeapon`): a fraction of the weapon's own
 * reach envelope (`reachGrid`, the same engine function `balance/weaponProfile.ts` uses),
 * and half a second of projectile flight. Whichever is tighter wins, and the shipped
 * `careful` spacing is the ceiling. Every weapon is then measured at a range where it can
 * actually connect, which is the only way a cross-weapon comparison means anything.
 *
 * ## How to read the report — the confounds, stated up front
 *
 * Same standing caveat as the PvP sim: a cheap repeatable FIRST SIGNAL, not a tuning
 * verdict. No single column is the answer, and two of them mislead on their own:
 *
 *   - `t/kill` REWARDS DYING EARLY. It is total ticks ÷ total kills, and a weapon whose run
 *     ended quickly in a target-rich room scores well on it. On the 2026-09-04 run
 *     `lasercutter` and `gyre` led the table at ~46 t/kill on 54-55 total kills and floor 0,
 *     while `stormglaive` sat mid-table at ~54 on 882 kills and floor 3 — the beam is not
 *     better than the glaive, it died sooner. Read t/kill beside the kill total and the
 *     floor reached, never alone.
 *
 *   - The bot does not lead shots and does not aim AoE at clusters, so slow projectiles
 *     (`seeker` 7 grid/s, `frostseeker` 6, `mortar` 8) and blast radii are under-reported
 *     on principle. It also never swaps weapons — the point of the sweep, but it means each
 *     weapon is judged with no fallback for the situations it is bad at.
 *
 * Any absolute figure quoted in this header is ILLUSTRATIVE, not pinned: these are real runs
 * against the shipped level and the shipped enemy AI, so every number here moves whenever
 * either changes. That is why the pace gate below compares each weapon against the SAME
 * run's best rather than against a recorded constant.
 *
 * Read a LOW score as "the bot could not use this" before "this is weak". Read the GATES as
 * the real regression checks: they encode "the mechanic fires at all", which is the failure
 * mode a static test genuinely cannot see.
