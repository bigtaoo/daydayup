/**
 * levelSim.ts — the end-to-end half of the level simulator: a real `createGameEngine`
 * run over the real shipped level, driven by `PveBotController`, with per-room metrics
 * recorded. These tests are about the HARNESS being trustworthy (does it record what
 * it claims to, is it reproducible, does it terminate); the balance numbers themselves
 * are the job of `sim/pveLevelSim.sim.ts`, which is excluded from the default `npm
 * test` glob because full 5-floor runs are slow.
 *
 * Everything here is therefore capped with a small `maxTicks`: enough real ticks to
 * activate the entrance room and take fire, cheap enough for the normal suite.
