/**
 * The level simulator: drive one full PvE run headlessly and record what it felt
 * like to be shot at.
 *
 * Built for a specific, repeated failure mode — a live report that a room's garrison
 * deletes the player before they can react ("一进游戏就被集火秒杀"). That bug has now
 * been "fixed" twice from reasoning alone (ENGINE_VERSION 40's fire-range gate, and
 * v37's chase before it) without anything in the repo able to say how much incoming
 * damage a room actually produces. This measures it:
 *
 *   - `reactionTicks` — activation → first damage taken. The number the report is
 *     really about; a player needs roughly a second to read a room.
 *   - `peakShooters` — most enemies firing at the player in the same tick, per room.
 *     The literal definition of 集火 (focus fire).
 *   - `peakBurstDamage` — worst 1-second damage window of the run, against the
 *     player's own effective HP pool (`hp + shield`), which is what decides whether
 *     a burst is survivable at all.
 *   - clear time and where the run ended, so a nerf can be checked for overshoot —
 *     an unkillable room and a boring one are both failures.
 *
 * It runs the REAL content through the REAL engine: `buildDungeonRunConfig` is the
 * same function `Game.beginRun` calls, so the simulated run is byte-identical to
 * pressing START (design/06 anti-drift — no second hand-mirrored copy of the run
 * config), and `PveBotController` reaches the engine through nothing but
 * `PlayerCommand`s. What it is NOT is a claim about human skill: a bot's aim is
 * perfect and its nerve never breaks. Read it as a floor on difficulty ("even a
 * tireless kiter dies here"), not as a verdict on how a person will do.
