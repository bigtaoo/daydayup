/**
 * Room encounter budget (design/05 "Room encounter budget", ENGINE_VERSION 41) —
 * how much of a room's garrison is allowed to shoot at the player AT ONCE, and how
 * long the room takes to wake up.
 *
 * These exist because room-wide aggro plus a per-enemy fire decision multiplies:
 * every mob independently doing the reasonable thing (close in, then shoot) adds up
 * to an unsurvivable volley, and no per-enemy number can fix that — 15 enemies each
 * firing a 1-damage shot every 1.5s is 10 damage/second against a starter character's
 * 9.2 effective HP, whatever each individual mob's stats say. `client/sim/
 * pveLevelSim.sim.ts` measured exactly that on the shipped level 1: 14 of 15 enemies
 * firing simultaneously, first hit 0.6s after the room woke, dead in ~2s, in 100% of
 * bot runs at both skill profiles.
 *
 * So the budget is a property of the ROOM, not of the mob — the same place aggro
 * already lives (design/05's room-as-the-aggro-unit model). A room may hold a crowd;
 * only `ROOM_FIRE_BUDGET` of them may be shooting at any instant, and the rest queue
 * up at their engage range waiting for a slot to open (which happens when a shooter
 * dies, or when the player moves and someone else becomes the nearest). That is the
 * standard arrangement in the games this one takes after — a room of 15 reads as
 * dangerous without being an execution.
 *
 * Both numbers are deliberately in `balance/` rather than `content/enemies.ts`: they
 * are not a property of any one blueprint, they are the encounter-level dial the
 * level's difficulty is actually tuned on. Re-run `npm run test:pve-sim` after
 * touching either — its balance gates are what hold them honest.

/**
 * Most enemies in one room that may have `firing` set on the same tick. The nearest
 * ones to the target win the slots (`AIDecideSystem`), so the threat always comes
 * from the mobs closest to the player rather than from an arbitrary array-order
 * subset.
 *
 * Sizing, measured rather than assumed: each shooter is one `ENEMY_GUN_SIM` shot per
 * 1.5s = 0.67 damage/s. At 3 slots the sim's careful bot cleared the entrance room
 * but died on floor 1 in every run — a room cost 5-9 damage against a renewable 3.2
 * shield, so the 6-point HP pool drained one room at a time with no way back up. At 2
 * it costs 4-8, floor 1 is passable but not free (the careful bot descends in ~37% of
 * runs and deaths spread across floors 0-3), which is the difficulty this level is
 * aiming for. Survival comes down to spacing and movement — a mob that is closing
 * distance cannot shoot at all (v40) — which is the intended skill axis.

// ── Standing spacing (ENGINE_VERSION 55) ────────────────────────────────────────
/**
 * How far a mob that has ARRIVED spreads from its neighbours, as a multiple of its own
 * body `radius` (live play report 2026-09-03: *"怪物寻路时要加一个停留体积，最好是两倍于
 * 怪物的体型，这样怪物才会分散"* — a screenshot of three mobs stacked into one silhouette,
 * two health bars overlapping a third body).
 *
 * The report names the thing that was missing precisely: a mob has ONE size today and it
 * answers two different questions. Travelling, its size should be its body, or it cannot
 * fit through a gap the level authored for it. Standing, its size should be its personal
 * space, which is a much bigger circle — otherwise every mob in a room converges on the
 * same engage-range ring around the player and parks there, feet-circle to feet-circle
 * (`footprintRadius`, 7 px against a 15 px body), i.e. as a blob.
 *
 * So this multiple applies ONLY between two mobs that are both holding position
 * (`EnemyActor.holding`), and only to each other — never to a mob that is still moving,
 * never to a player, and never to a wall. That restriction is the whole design: a 1.5-body
 * gap stays passable at full speed because the travelling mob is judged at its body, while
 * two mobs that stop next to each other end up 2+2 = 4 body radii apart. Both halves of the
 * report, from one flag.
 *
 * 2 is the reported number and it is also about right against the numbers already here: at
 * a basic mob's 15 px radius it puts standing mobs 60 px apart, so roughly 18 fit around the
 * 180 px `DEFAULT_ENEMY_ENGAGE_RANGE_FP` ring before the crowd has to fall back to a second
 * one — a level-1 room's 15-30 garrison spreads into a loose arc rather than a column.

/**
 * How far past its engage range a mob may be pushed by the spacing above before it counts
 * as no longer holding and starts closing again (per-mille of `engageRangeFp`).
 *
 * Hysteresis, for the same reason `aggroed` is a latch: spacing moves a standing mob
 * OUTWARD, so a mob that stopped exactly on the engage ring is pushed just outside it by
 * its neighbour, and with a bare `dist <= range` test it would immediately re-chase, close
 * the gap, be pushed out again — a permanent shuffle at the ring, and (since fire slots go
 * to mobs in range) a gun that stutters on and off with it. Holding is therefore sticky:
 * entered at `engageRangeFp`, left only past this wider radius. A mob spread out to the
 * 1.5× band still shoots — `ENEMY_GUN_SIM`'s bullets travel ~30 grid, five times that far.
