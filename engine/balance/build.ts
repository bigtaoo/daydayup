/**
 * The build layer — the fairness wall (design/05/06/09). Two builders resolve
 * authored loadouts into the WeaponState[] a PlayerActor spawns with, and the
 * TYPES themselves enforce the PvP fairness guarantee:
 *
 *   buildRunSpecs(baseLoadout)          — PvE: the persistent meta loadout (horizontal).
 *   buildArenaSpecs(presetId, skinId)   — PvP: a preset id + which character, NOTHING else.
 *
 * buildArenaSpecs physically cannot receive meta (weapon/material/blueprint) — there
 * is no parameter for it (design/09 "compile-time impossible to leak persistent gear
 * into PvP", unit-tested by arity). `skinId` is NOT a wall violation: design/14/15
 * name character choice as the fairness wall's one deliberate exception (a player's
 * chosen skin carries into PvP same as PvE) — it is what lets buildArenaSpecs apply
 * the PvP HP/weapon scale factor (design/15) to the RIGHT (maxHp, maxShield) pair.
 * PvP power beyond the landing kit + character choice comes only from on-map pickups
 * (design/05). This is design/05's hybrid-gear table made executable.
 *
 * buildRunSpecs is wired into GameState construction and (via makeWeapon) the
 * in-run weapon drops. buildArenaSpecs (ROADMAP 4.2c) is ALSO wired into GameState
 * construction (buildSeat branches on config.arena, ENGINE_VERSION 19->20) — PvP
 * mode is assembled end-to-end (Phase 4 closeout, ROADMAP.md).

 * fight, via the swap control, not one the spawn makes for them). A one-weapon kit
 * also silently removed the swap verb from PvP entirely: `HudView`'s idle-slot chip
 * hides itself when `weapons.length <= 1`, so the arena had no visible second slot
 * and no parry at all.
 *
 * Consequence worth naming: parry (`MeleeSimSpec.deflect`) is now available to every

 * weapon off the map. That is the point — both halves of design/03's trade-off should
 * be in a player's hands — but it does move PvP's bullet-vs-body balance, and the
 * zone/TTK tuning below is still first-pass (design/15 "real play required").
 *

 * kit is arena-scoped authored content (the fairness wall — it must not read
 * `PLAYER_BASE.startWeapons`, which is where the PvE meta's defaults live). The
