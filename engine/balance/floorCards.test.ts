/**
 * Floor cards (design/05, ENGINE_VERSION 58) — the pure half: the catalogue, the offer
 * draw, and the vote tally. The end-to-end half (the offer opening with the portal, a
 * descend holding for a pick, the reward reaching every seat) lives in
 * `systems/floorCardCheckpoint.test.ts`, driven through a real engine.
 *
 * The tally is where most of these assertions sit, because it is the piece with a
 * genuine correctness surface: it runs INDEPENDENTLY on every client in a lockstep
 * match (design/06), so a rule that resolves differently on two machines — a re-roll, a
 * coin flip, an iteration over an unordered map — desyncs the run rather than merely
 * picking a different card.
