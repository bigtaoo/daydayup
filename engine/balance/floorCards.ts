/**
 * Floor cards — the "pick one of three" reward at a floor's checkpoint (design/05,
 * ENGINE_VERSION 58). Asked for by the game's owner on 2026-09-05, in the shape Soul
 * Knight established: clear a floor, get offered three upgrades, take one.
 *
 * It is the counterweight to the same day's loot pass. Potions went from 21% of kills
 * to 2.4% and a floor's weapons were capped at 2-3, which makes a run scarcer but does
 * not give the player anything to steer. These do: the power a run gains is now mostly
 * a sequence of choices at four checkpoints rather than whatever happened to drop.
 *
 * ## Plain data + pure functions
 *
 * Same contract as `runbuffs.ts` next door (design/09 "content is plain data"): a
 * catalogue keyed by id, i18n KEYS only and never display text, and every function here
 * pure. Nothing in this file knows what a `GameState` is — `ExtractionSystem` owns the
 * checkpoint that offers a card and the descend that applies one.
 *
 * ## Three effect kinds, and why they are not all buffs
 *
 * `buff` cards are deliberately a thin wrapper over the EXISTING `RUN_BUFFS` catalogue
 * rather than a parallel one: a card that grants `dmg_up` should be exactly as strong as
 * the `dmg_up` that drops off the floor, and the Sigma-then-clamp caps in `BUFF_CAPS`
 * should bound both together. A second damage-scaling path is precisely the drift
 * design/18's consistency gates exist to catch.
 *
 * The other two kinds exist because they are NOT player stats. `heal_drop_mult` changes
 * the drop table, and `weapon_quota` changes how many weapons a floor allocates; neither
 * has anywhere to live on a `PlayerActor`, and both are properties of the RUN rather
 * than of a person in it. That distinction is also why they are re-derived from the
 * picked-card list on read (`resolveFloorCards`) instead of being copied into a mutable
 * counter: there is one place a card's effect is written down, and it is this file.
 *
 * ## Team-wide, on the owner's call
 *
 * A card benefits the whole squad, not the seat that voted for it (2026-09-05). The vote
 * is collective — most votes wins, `tallyCardVote` — so the reward is collective too;
 * a per-voter reward would turn a shared decision into four private ones and make the
 * majority rule actively unfair to whoever lost it.

 *     skipped rather than counted for slot 1 — a downed or AFK teammate must not drag
 *     the squad's pick, and a solo player who has not chosen yet gets 0 back, which is
