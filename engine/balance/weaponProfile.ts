/**
 * Weapon balance profiles (design/03/05/14) — the authored catalog reduced to a small set
 * of COMPARABLE axes, so "is this weapon a real choice or a strictly worse one?" is a
 * question with an answer instead of a judgement call.
 *
 * This is the weapon counterpart of what `content/skins.ts` + `skins.test.ts` already do
 * for characters (Pareto non-domination, per-axis spread, equal-worth budget band). It is
 * deliberately NOT a clone of that shape, because weapons are not characters:
 *
 *   - Characters are meant to be EQUAL WORTH — design/14's "side-grades, no power ladder" —
 *     so a total-budget band is the right gate for them.
 *   - Weapons are explicitly NOT equal worth. design/05 names "finding a better weapon" as
 *     the in-run power axis, and rarity is an intrinsic tier on top of that. A rarer weapon
 *     is SUPPOSED to be better.
 *
 * So the numeric axes here answer a narrower question, and the module is honest about where
 * it stops: **it cannot price a mechanic.** Homing, an AoE blast, a hitscan beam, a bounce,
 * a chill — each is worth something, and nothing in this repo says how much. Every attempt
 * to fold them into one composite "worth" number would be inventing the exchange rate and
 * then testing the invention. What the axes below CAN do is separate weapons that differ
 * mechanically (where the trade is real, and unmeasurable from data alone) from weapons that
 * do not (where one being worse on every axis is just a worse weapon). The empirical
 * pricing lives elsewhere, in `client/sim/weaponSweep.sim.ts`, which plays each weapon
 * through a real level and measures what it actually clears.
 *
 * Every axis is "higher is better" and stays in AUTHORED HUMAN UNITS (seconds, grid,
 * degrees, integer damage) — the point is to compare design intent, so converting to
 * fp/brad/ticks first would only add rounding between two numbers being subtracted.
