/**
 * Weapon energy — the ammo economy (design/03/05, ENGINE_VERSION 59, 2026-09-05).
 *
 * Two design calls from the game's owner, made together because they are one
 * question: *"我打算给武器加一个子弹的概念。1，能解决武器平衡性问题…… 2，能解决怪物
 * 掉落的问题。毕竟降低了掉率之后打完地图空空如也也不好。"*
 *
 * ## Why a shared regenerating POOL and not per-weapon magazines
 *
 * Soul Knight's energy model, which is also the reference design/05 keeps citing.
 * A magazine model was considered and rejected on three counts, all of them
 * properties of THIS repo rather than general taste:
 *
 *   - It needs a RELOAD verb. `10` removed aim input entirely and the button cluster
 *     is already full; and a reload is a pause, which lockstep cannot give one player
 *     (`06`).
 *   - It puts state on a weapon, so a weapon lying on the floor has to carry its
 *     remaining rounds through `PickupItem` and back out again on a drop-on-replace
 *     swap (`03`). A pool belongs to the PLAYER, so a swap moves nothing.
 *   - Per-weapon ammo TYPES were rejected for a content reason: a floor hands out
 *     2-3 weapons (`05`), so a gun you cannot feed wastes a third of the floor's
 *     entire weapon output.
 *
 * ## Why the cost is indexed on the MECHANIC, not on damage
 *
 * `03`'s measured roster shape forbids a damage-indexed price: mean dps by rarity
 * runs DOWNWARD (`fine` 8.41 -> `epic` 5.63 -> `legend` 3.75), because "rarity buys a
 * mechanic, not pace". Charging by damage would tax the legendary frames — already
 * the slowest guns in the game — hardest, and make the starter blaster strictly
 * best. What the roster was missing is stated in `03` in as many words: *"a mechanic
 * has no price anywhere in this repo"*, which is exactly why `weaponBalance.test.ts`
 * can only gate domination WITHIN an identical mechanical signature. `energyCost` is
 * that missing price — the first exchange rate the balance layer has ever had.
 *
 * ## How the numbers were sized (measured, not guessed)
 *
 * The same discipline `05`'s loot-economy pass used. `client/sim/pve/report.ts`'s
 * `floorFireStats` was built FIRST and read, over 8 careful bot runs of the shipped
 * level:
 *
 *   | floor | complete visits | kills | trigger pulls (avg/min/max) | pulls/kill |
 *   |-------|-----------------|-------|-----------------------------|------------|
 *   | 0     | 3               | 34.6  | 217 / 237 / 252             | 6.3        |
 *   | 1     | 2               | 37.7  | 536 / 730 / 760             | 14.2       |
 *   | 2     | 1               | 52    | 598 / 742 / 742             | 11.5       |
 *
 * Two findings decided the shape of everything below.
 *
 * **Pulls per kill RISES with depth** (6.3 -> 14.2), because `difficultyCurve` scales
 * enemy HP per floor while a drop table is priced per KILL. So an ammo economy funded
 * only by kill-drops goes negative with depth — it would be tightest exactly on the
 * floors the level is already hardest on (100% of careful bot runs die today). That
 * is why the pool REGENERATES on a clock: a time-based refill is depth-invariant,
 * and the drop is a burst top-up on top of it rather than the whole supply.
 *
 * **A floor costs 237-760 pulls and hands back ~35-52 drops.** No per-kill drop can
 * fund a 250-pull floor at a meaningful price per pull. So the baseline gun has to be
 * effectively free, and the economy has to bite only on the expensive frames — which
 * is precisely the design goal ("有些大威力的武器一次就要消耗大量子弹") rather than a
 * concession to it.
 *
 * ## The break-even rule that ties the two together
 *
 * A weapon firing continuously spends `energyCost / cooldownSec` per second against
 * `ENERGY_REGEN_PER_SEC`. Below it, the weapon is sustainable forever and the pool is
 * invisible; above it, the pool drains and the weapon becomes regen-paced once empty.
 * The starter `blaster` is deliberately placed BELOW the line with headroom, which is
 * what keeps the shipped level's difficulty unmoved for a fresh-save loadout — see
 * `content/weaponSpecs/` for each weapon's price and `balance/energy.test.ts` for the
 * assertions that pin the classification.
 */

 *  field and nothing to desync (`06`). Unconditional, unlike the shield's idle timer
