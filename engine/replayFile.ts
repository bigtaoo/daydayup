/**
 * The on-disk replay envelope: a recorded match as a single JSON file (design/06/08).
 *
 * `replay.ts` already had everything needed to RE-RUN a match — a Replay is
 * seed + config + input stream, and `runReplay` reconstructs it bit-for-bit. What it
 * never had was a way to get one OUT of a live session: nothing in `client/` or
 * `server/` referenced `toReplay`, so a player who hit a bug could hand over a seed
 * and nothing else. A seed is not a repro. Every position in a run — including where
 * a monster dies, and therefore where its loot lands — is a function of the input
 * stream, so the stream is the only thing that reproduces a report.
 *
 * This module is the file format around that stream, and it lives in the engine (not
 * the client) for one reason: the writer is the client and the reader is a headless
 * harness, and a format with two independent parsers is a format that drifts. It is
 * pure data — no DOM, no fs — so the engine stays host-free (see engine/README.md).
 *
 * The whole `EngineConfig` is embedded rather than a "how to rebuild it" descriptor
 * (mode + seed + arena id). That costs file size and buys the thing this format
 * exists for: the geometry in the file IS the geometry the run had. A descriptor
 * would rebuild the world from today's content, and "the level changed under the
 * repro" is precisely the class of confusion a bug report cannot afford. Content is
 * not covered by ENGINE_VERSION, so nothing else would catch it.
