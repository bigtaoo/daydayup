/**
 * THE HAND-AUTHORED PLAN for the launch arena (design/15's "one ~60-room hand-authored map
 * at launch, produced by a dedicated map editor — not a procedural layout").
 *
 * Everything in this file is a decision, written the way it would be drawn on graph paper.
 * `launchArena.ts` assembles it into an `ArenaMap`; `slotGrid.ts` does the arithmetic. The
 * split is deliberate: this file should be readable and arguable by someone who does not
 * care how a wall run is computed, and it should diff line-by-line when the map changes.
 *
 * ## The shape: districts joined by a few arteries
 *
 * Seven districts of 6–14 rooms, laid on one hand-drawn 9x8 slot grid with 12 slots left
 * EMPTY so the map is not a lattice. Column widths and row heights vary, so room footprints
 * range from 9x9 closets to 20x14 halls — a slot's size is a design choice, not a constant.
 *
 * Districts connect only through a short list of ARTERIES (below). That is where the map's
 * decisions live: inside a district you have options, but leaving one is a commitment
 * through a place someone can be waiting. A battle royale needs that — the zone tells you
 * WHERE to go, and the layout is what makes the trip cost something.
 *
 *   terraces   NW   open, long sightlines, thin cover — the exposed district
 *   kilns      N    hazard-heavy, phased spike fields
 *   cisterns   W    colonnades and rings; sightlines broken across, open along
 *   atrium     mid  the hub: biggest halls, richest loot, the usual eye of the zone
 *   barracks   NE/E tight rooms, stubs and chevrons — close quarters
 *   catacombs  S/SE the maze: most rooms, most dead ends, lowest visibility
 *   foundry    SW   dense industrial cover, rubble and stubs
 *
 * ## What the previous map got wrong, and what this plan does about it
 *
 * `arena_prototype_60` was 60 identical 10x10 rooms with `solids: []` everywhere, so it had
 * no walls at all: its rooms and all 71 of its doors were logical-only and an actor walked
 * straight across the map. Here every room's perimeter is real stone and a door is the only
 * hole in it, so the door graph the zone's BFS reasons over is the graph a player actually
 * moves on. Its pillars and loot markers were also authored as ABSOLUTE coordinates where
 * the engine expects room-relative, putting 90 of 120 features off the map; nothing in this
 * plan names an absolute coordinate at all — slots and kits are positioned by the grid.
