/**
 * A first hand-authored RoomPiece library (design/09 "hand-authored pieces",
 * ROADMAP 1.3) — the demo's single biome, tagged 'ember'. Five normal pieces
 * (varied solids/pillars so a floor doesn't feel identical room to room), one
 * extraction-role piece, one boss-role piece (its encounter spawns the existing
 * `blightlord` finale, content/enemies.ts). Grid units, human-authored
 * (design/09); `content/rooms.ts roomGeometry` converts once at placement.
 *
 * **No longer the shipped level's pool.** `EMBER_DUNGEON` (below) is now a fully
 * hand-authored 5-floor level whose content is the separate `'ember_l1'` library in
 * ./emberLevel1.ts. These seven pieces stay exported and tested: they are the
 * fixtures `world/dungeon.test.ts` drives `generateFloor`/`placeFloorGraph2d` with,
 * and everything the rest of this comment records was found by those sweeps.
 *
 * `'graph2d'` content (design/05, 2026-08-05 follow-up): `EMBER_DUNGEON.layout`
 * switched from `'linear'` to `'graph2d'` this pass, so a generated Ember floor
 * can genuinely bend north/south instead of only ever walking a west→east
 * spine. `ember_cross` already authored all 4 exits (it just had no
 * exit-matching partner before); `ember_pillars` gained `north`+`south` on top
 * of its existing `west`+`east` (its two pillars sit well clear of the N/S
 * walls, same clearance margin `pickDoorAnchor2d` already enforces generically),
 * and the new `ember_atrium` is a fully open room (no interior solids at all)
 * with all 4 exits, purpose-built as a flexible mid-floor connector. Deliberately
 * a DIFFERENT width (14) from every existing piece (20/18/16/24) — `'branching'`
 * still stays unused by any shipped config (only same-width normal pieces are
 * fork-eligible, design/05's "fully-realized branching" pass), and this pass
 * doesn't touch that; picking a colliding width here would be an accidental,
 * undocumented opt-in to forking the instant someone flips `layout` to
 * `'branching'` later. A west/east-only piece (`ember_hall`/`ember_narrow`)
 * still never bends mid-floor on its own — bending only happens when BOTH
 * sides of a transition offer a matching exit — but a floor that draws two of
 * {cross, pillars, atrium} back-to-back now has a real, PRNG-drawn choice of
 * direction, and the pool's first (spawn) room already had this "walk either
 * of two ways" freedom whenever it draws any west+east piece (module doc in
 * `world/dungeon.ts`).
 *
 * `ember_extraction`/`ember_boss` gained all 4 exits (previously `west`-only) —
 * found NOT by inspection but by two rounds of brute-force testing this pass
 * added (`dungeon.test.ts`'s EMBER_DUNGEON seed-sweep, then an exhaustive
 * enumeration over every `(normal1, normal2, capstone)` combo the real pool can
 * produce), each surfacing a distinct way the ORIGINAL `west`-only capstone
 * could dead-end or fold back:
 * 1. **Dead end (connectivity):** the spawn stage (undefined `entryEdge`)
 *    always offers BOTH `west` and `east` as viable first moves (every normal
 *    piece authors both), so a 2-normal-stage floor can legitimately draw
 *    `'west'` for its first hop — placing stage 1 WEST of the spawn, entered
 *    via stage 1's own `east` side, consuming it. Stage 1's only remaining exit
 *    is then `west`, but a `west`-only capstone has no `east` to receive it —
 *    zero viable directions, `placeFloorGraph2d` fails loud (module doc: "no
 *    solver", the content author is responsible for a compatible sequence).
 *    Fix: give the capstone `east` too — whichever single edge a room was
 *    entered through, the OTHER of {west, east} is always still open on it, so
 *    the capstone is now reachable from either side.
 * 2. **Fold-back (overlap), found only once (1) was fixed and the seed-sweep
 *    could reach a THIRD stage:** `ember_boss` (22×18, the pool's tallest+widest
 *    piece) connecting via `west` OR `east` centers itself on the PREVIOUS
 *    room's own centerline (`placeAdjacent2d`) — if that previous room is
 *    shorter than `ember_boss` (true of every other piece), the overhang can
 *    reach past it into whatever sits on the OTHER side, regardless of which
 *    of the two horizontal directions is tried. Fix: give the capstone `north`+
 *    `south` too, so when the floor already bent vertically to reach it,
 *    `placeFloorGraph2d`'s direction-retry (its own doc comment,
 *    `world/dungeon.ts`) has a THIRD option — continuing the SAME bend outward,
 *    away from every earlier room, instead of only ever doubling back
 *    horizontally across one. Adding exits to a capstone is provably
 *    never unsafe on its own (`placeFloorGraph2d`'s retry tries every viable
 *    direction before giving up, so a larger viable set can only ever add a
 *    successful option, never remove one) — the exhaustive enumeration test
 *    below is what turns "provably can't make things worse" into "confirmed
 *    zero failures over the actual finite pool", since a hand-argued proof
 *    that some Nth combination is fine is exactly the kind of claim worth
 *    machine-checking once. The capstone still only ever gets ONE door in
 *    practice (it is always the last stage — nothing places beyond it), so
 *    every added exit is a fallback connectivity/safety option, never a
 *    second door.

/**
 * The Ember biome's dungeon descriptor (design/05/09, ROADMAP 1.3) — the game's
 * level 1, and the one `EngineConfig.dungeon` config every PvE run (offline and
 * online) is built from.
 *
 * **Now a fully hand-authored level (design/05 "Hand-authored PvE floors").** All
 * five floor indices are present in `floorMaps`, so `SpawnSystem` takes the
 * `placeAuthoredFloor` path for every floor of a real run and the procedural
 * `generateFloor`/`placeFloorGraph2d` pair costs zero `roomgenPrng` draws. The
 * content itself — 14 `RoomPiece`s and 5 `DungeonFloorMap`s — is JSON under
 * `world/dungeons/ember/`, loaded by `./emberLevel1.ts`, and is meant to be tuned
 * in `tools/map-editor` rather than here. Pair this config with `EMBER_L1_ROOMS`
 * (NOT `EMBER_ROOMS`) as the library: that is where every `pieceId` the floor maps
 * reference lives.
 *
 * Floors 0-3 are capped by `ember_l1_extraction` (the checkpoint), floor 4 by
 * `ember_l1_boss` (the blightlord finale, which doubles as its own extraction).
 * Room counts run 5 / 6 / 7 / 6 / 5 — a shape `roomsPerFloor`'s min/max range
 * structurally cannot express, which is exactly why the floors are authored rather
 * than drawn; the range below describes only the procedural FALLBACK a floor would
 * take if its authored map were ever removed.
 *
 * `difficultyCurve` drops to `perFloor: 0.5` alongside the floor count going 3 → 5:
 * `curveAt` is a plain `base + perFloor * floorIndex` multiplier on enemy maxHp
 * (`content/enemies.ts`), so the previous `perFloor: 1` would have taken the
 * deepest floor from ×3 to ×5 purely as a side effect of adding floors. ×0.5 keeps
 * the same ×3 ceiling, now reached over five floors instead of three.
 *
 * `layout: 'graph2d'` (design/05, 2026-08-05 follow-up; was `'linear'`) — the
 * module doc above lists which pieces actually make a floor bend now. Only the
 * fallback path reads it at all, since every floor here is authored.
 *
 * `EMBER_ROOMS` above is no longer this config's pool (it is now the `'ember_l1'`
 * pool in `./emberLevel1.ts`). The seven original pieces stay exported and tested:
 * they are the fixtures `world/dungeon.test.ts`'s placement/seed-sweep suites drive
 * `placeFloorGraph2d` with, and the module doc above records what those sweeps
 * found — deleting them would delete that coverage, not just the content.
