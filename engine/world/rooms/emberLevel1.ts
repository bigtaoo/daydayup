/**
 * Level 1 ("the Ember descent") — the shipped PvE level's hand-authored content,
 * loaded from `world/dungeons/ember/`.
 *
 * This module is a LOADER, not an authoring surface: every piece and every floor is
 * plain JSON on disk, in exactly the two shapes `tools/map-editor` reads and writes
 * (`RoomPiece` for the "PvE Room Library" tab, `DungeonFloorMap` for the "PvE
 * Dungeon Floor" tab), so the level can be tuned in the editor without touching a
 * line of TypeScript. The same precedent PvP already set for its 60-room arena
 * (`world/arenas/arena_prototype_60.json`, loaded by
 * `client/src/game/match/arenaCatalog.ts`) — content lives under `world/`, code only
 * points at it.
 *
 * Shape of the level (the spec this content was seeded against, and what
 * `emberLevel1.test.ts` holds it to):
 *   - 5 floors, 5 / 6 / 7 / 6 / 5 rooms each — the capstone counts as one of them.
 *   - Every room between 15x15 and 20x20 grid cells.
 *   - Enemy count per room ramps with the room's cell count, 15 at 15x15 up to 30 at
 *     20x20. The one deliberate exception is the extraction capstone (0 enemies): it
 *     is the checkpoint/portal room, and `DoorSystem`/`ExtractionSystem` both treat
 *     "capstone cleared" as the floor's own gate, so garrisoning it would turn every
 *     checkpoint into a second boss fight.
 *   - Floors 0-3 are capped by `ember_l1_extraction`, floor 4 by `ember_l1_boss`
 *     (which doubles as its own extraction, design/05).
 *
 * Because all 5 floor indices are present in `EMBER_L1_FLOORS`, `SpawnSystem` takes
 * the `placeAuthoredFloor` path for every floor of a real run — the procedural
 * `generateFloor`/`placeFloorGraph2d` path costs zero `roomgenPrng` draws here and
 * only ever runs as a fallback if a floor map is removed.
 *
 * The JSON was seeded by `tools/map-editor/scripts/genEmberLevel1.mjs` (a one-shot
 * generator, deliberately not wired into any npm script — re-running it overwrites
 * editor tweaks). The JSON is the source of truth from here on, not the script.
