 * hand-placed PvE door is no different a shape from a hand-placed PvP one.
 *
 * Array order carries meaning, reusing the two single-index assumptions already
 * baked into the engine rather than inventing a third: `rooms[0]` is the
 * entrance/spawn room (`SpawnSystem`'s `placed[0]`), `rooms[rooms.length - 1]` is
 * the capstone extraction/boss room (`ExtractionSystem`'s
 * `dungeonRoomRuntime[length - 1]`). This module trusts that ordering — it fails
 * loud only on a broken reference (a missing piece/room id), never re-validates
 * placement or the capstone convention; `tools/map-editor`'s
 * `validateDungeonFloorMap` is the save-time gate for those, matching how
 * `validateArenaMap` is PvP's own save-time gate rather than an engine-side check.
