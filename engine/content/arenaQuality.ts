/**
 * The arena quality GATE (design/15) — `arenaMetrics`/`arenaGeometryMetrics` measure a map,
 * this decides whether the measurement is acceptable.
 *
 * Why it is separate from `sim/arenaAudit.sim.ts`: that prints a report for a person to read,
 * and a report cannot fail CI. Why it is separate from `world/arenas/launchArena.test.ts`:
 * that asserts the shipped map's own geometry, by hand, for `arena_launch` specifically. This
 * is the bar EVERY map in the catalog is held to, so the next arena is measured against it on
 * the day it lands rather than the day someone remembers to write its test. The two overlap
 * deliberately on the geometry invariants — a per-map test is free to be stricter, and the
 * gate has to keep holding once that map is deleted.
 *
 * ## How the thresholds were chosen
 *
 * NOT by transcribing what `arena_launch` scores. Every bound below is an answer to "what
 * would make a PvP arena unplayable, or unauthored", and each is far enough from the shipped
 * map's own number that the map has real headroom — `arenaQuality.test.ts` asserts that
 * headroom, so a threshold quietly tightened onto the current content fails there.
 *
 * Two severities, and the distinction is not cosmetic:
 *   - `defect` — wrong at ANY nonzero value, and every one of them is a bug that really
 *     shipped. `arena_prototype_60` (deleted 2026-08-26) authored its pillars and loot in the
 *     wrong coordinate space and left `solids: []` everywhere, so its 71 doors gated nothing
 *     and 90 of 120 markers landed off the map. Those are the rules with a 0 bound.
 *   - `design` — a band, where both ends are a real failure and the middle is a judgement
 *     call. A map can be structurally perfect and still be a shooting gallery.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated: `chokepoints` and `deadEnds`. Both read as defects from a graph
 * metric and are legitimate authored content — a vault worth walking into a dead end for is
 * the whole point of one, and `arena_launch` ships 8 dead ends and 10 chokepoints on purpose.
 * Gating them would be the "transcribe the current score" mistake pointed the other way.
