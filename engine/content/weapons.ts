/**
 * Weapon content (design/09) — the one-time conversion of the authored catalog into the
 * sim-facing WeaponSimSpec that systems consume. This is the single place the conversion
 * happens; edit the mechanics here, and the actual weapon numbers in weaponSpecs.ts.
 *
 * Split 2026-07-28 (was one 700+ line file): weaponTypes.ts holds the authored WeaponSpec
 * schema, weaponSpecs.ts the WEAPON_SPECS catalog data, and this file the conversion +
 * sim-facing lookups — both re-exported here so callers keep importing from `weapons`.
 *
 * Moved into @dd/engine in Stage C (was client/src/game/content/weapons.ts). The
 * hand-tuned WeaponSimSpec constants that lived in sim.config.ts during Stage B are
 * superseded by `toSimSpec()` applied to these authored specs — the numbers now
 * flow human-units → converter → sim once, at construction.
 *
 * Authored in HUMAN UNITS: seconds, grid-units/second, degrees, integer damage,
 * grid distances. Conversion (design/09):
 *   toTicks(sec)      = round(sec · 30)
 *   toFpGrid(grid)    = round(grid · 1000)
 *   toFpPerTick(g/s)  = ⌊round(g/s · 1000) · 33 / 1000⌋   // fp displacement / tick
 *   degToBrad(deg)    = round(deg / 360 · 65536)
