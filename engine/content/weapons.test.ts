/**
 * `toSimSpec` — the authored → sim CONVERSION CONTRACT (design/09 convert-once).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `content/weapons.ts` had no test of its own. It was exercised only sideways — by
 * `balance/rarity.test.ts` (the damage edge), `systems/meleeWindow.test.ts` (`swingTicks`),
 * and two client render sweeps (`muzzleParity`, `rigAttackMotion`) — and every one of those
 * reads the ONE field it cares about. Nothing anywhere asserted that the other twenty-odd
 * authored fields arrive at all.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical gap. `toSimSpec` has dropped an authored field on the floor
 * three separate times, and each one shipped:
 *
 *   - `piercing`   — authored on `RangedSpec` since Stage C, converted by nothing until
 *                    `ENGINE_VERSION` 28.
 *   - `ricochetCount` — same batch; found only because someone went looking at the
 *                    piercing branch next door.
 *   - `swingSec`   — authored on EVERY melee weapon since Stage C, converted by nothing
 *                    until `ENGINE_VERSION` 53, so for ~45 engine versions every blade's
 *                    active hit window was one tick regardless of what its spec said, and
 *                    the third axis of design/03's "swing shape" did not exist.
 *
 * Coverage cannot see this bug. `content/weapons.ts` reads 100% lines AND 100% branches
 * today — every `?? default` and `!== undefined ? … : undefined` ternary is exercised both
 * ways by some weapon in the catalog — and a dropped field is precisely a line that was
 * never written, so there is nothing for a percentage to miss.
 *
 * ## What is asserted
 *
 * A hand-written LANDING TABLE (`RANGED_LANDINGS` / `MELEE_LANDINGS`) names, for every
 * authored field, the sim-spec key it lands on and the formula that produces it. The table
 * is then closed on BOTH sides against reality, which is what makes it a gate rather than
 * documentation:
 *
 *   authored → table   every key any shipped weapon sets must be in the table; a new
 *                      authored field with no converter line fails here, by name.
 *   schema   → table   enforced by the COMPILER, not an assertion: the tables are typed
 *                      `Record<keyof RangedSpec, …>` / `Record<keyof MeleeSpec, …>`, so a
 *                      field declared in `weaponTypes.ts` with no landing line is a
 *                      `tsc --noEmit` error. That closes the hole `piercing` sat in for a
 *                      whole stage — declared, authored by nobody, converted by nothing —
 *                      without reaching for `node:fs` to regex the schema, which this
 *                      package's tsconfig withholds on purpose.
 *   table    → sim     every key `toSimSpec` actually emits must be claimed by a landing;
 *                      a sim field invented in the converter with no authored source fails.
 *
 * Formula arithmetic is pinned separately, on real weapons, with the design/09 conversion
 * spelled out in the comment so it can be checked by hand rather than against the
 * implementation it is supposed to be guarding.
 *
 * ## Mutation battery
 *
 * Recorded 2026-09-04 against `content/weapons.ts` (+ `weaponTypes.ts` / `convert.ts` /
 * `weaponSpecs/starter.ts` for the schema and catalog directions). Every row is a real
 * edit, then `npx tsc --noEmit` AND `npx vitest run content/weapons.test.ts`, revert. Both
 * are recorded because the schema direction is a compile-time gate — reporting only the
 * test column would show it as a survivor when it is the strongest check in the file.
 *
 *                                                                        tsc   tests
 *   KILLED  `piercing: spec.piercing ?? false` deleted (the bug, restaged)  —      19
 *   KILLED  `swingTicks: …` pinned back to the pre-v53 `1` ...............  —       8
 *   KILLED  `spreadHalf: degToBrad(spec.spreadDeg / 2)` → not halved .....  —       3
 *   KILLED  `ricochetCount: spec.ricochetCount` deleted .................  —       2
 *   KILLED  a new authored field (`recoilGrid`) on a weapon + the schema .  1       1
 *   KILLED  a schema-ONLY field (`chargeSec?`), authored by no weapon ....  1       0
 *   SURVIVED `toFpPerTick`'s `Math.trunc` → `Math.round` ................  —       0
 *
 * The `chargeSec` row is the interesting one: no assertion fires, because no weapon sets
 * the field and nothing in the catalog can therefore see it — the `Record<keyof …>` type is
 * what catches it, before a test ever runs. That is exactly the shape of the `piercing`
 * bug, and it is the reason the schema direction is a type and not a test.
 *
 * The survivor is recorded rather than hidden, and then closed by its own named case
 * below: every authored speed in the catalog is a whole grid/s, and `n · 33` is exact for
 * integer n, so truncation vs rounding changes no shipped number at all. A test built only
 * from real content provably cannot see it — which is the argument for the one assertion
 * in this file that calls a converter directly instead of reading a weapon.
 *
 * Not re-tested here (already owned elsewhere, deliberately not duplicated):
 * `swingTicks`'s [1, cooldown] clamp (`systems/meleeWindow.test.ts`), the rarity quality
 * edge's own arithmetic (`balance/rarity.test.ts`), and every field's runtime BEHAVIOUR
 * once converted (`systems/rangedCatalog.test.ts` — the sibling sweep that fires each
 * weapon and watches its own numbers move).
