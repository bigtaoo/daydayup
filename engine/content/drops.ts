// should be RARE, because the core loop this game wants is "clear the floor without
// getting hit" — a flood of potions replaces that goal with attrition. `heal` went

// (`SHIELD_REGEN_DELAY`/`SHIELD_REGEN_INTERVAL`, design/07's two-pool health) instead
// of from drinking. The baseline that motivated the number is measurable rather than
// asserted: `client/sim/pveLevelSim.sim.ts`'s loot table read 0.21 potions per kill,
// 7-10 per floor, over 16 real bot runs of the shipped level.
//

// deliberate — weapon COUNT is governed by the per-floor allowance
// (`GameState.floorWeaponQuota`, design/05), and mixing a weight change into the same
// pass would have made the two impossible to read apart. `effectiveWeights` keeps the
