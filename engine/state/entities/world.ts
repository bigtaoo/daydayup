   *   - `geom.clampToWalkable` — the same brimmed edge, so a dropped pickup can never settle
   *     inside a band no actor may stand in (ENGINE_VERSION 48);
   *   - `world/dungeon/floorGeometry.carveDoorGaps` — propagates the flag across the

   *
   * Deliberately NOT read by the bare `circleOverlapsAabb` path (bullets, doorway tests, zone
   * traits): those must keep hitting the real stone. That asymmetry is intended, and
   * `boundaryParity.test.ts` is where it is declared rather than left to this comment. The

   * *moving* geometry would silently desync the two.
