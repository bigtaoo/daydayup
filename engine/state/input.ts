/**
 * Input-edge quantization (design/06 "quantize move on input", design/08
 * "everything is already quantized for determinism"). This is the ONE place a
 * float controller sample is allowed to touch the input path: a mouse/joystick
 * move vector becomes integer brad + a 0..255 magnitude here, and that integer is
 * what gets recorded / broadcast / stepped. Every client and every replay reads
 * the same integer, so upstream float divergence in atan2/hypot is harmless.
 * (Aim used to be quantized here too — removed with manual aim itself, design/10;
 * facing is now engine-decided, see ApplyInputSystem.)
 *
 * Stage E formalizes this as an engine seam: the render-side CommandBuilder and
 * the golden-replay tests both go through these functions, so there is a single
 * quantization grid instead of an ad-hoc one duplicated on the render side.
 * Systems must NEVER call these — they use the deterministic integer atan2Brad.
