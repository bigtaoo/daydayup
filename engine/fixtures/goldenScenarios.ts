/**
 * The scenarios behind `golden.json` — shared by the gate (`engine/goldenHash.test.ts`) and
 * the recorder (`engine/scripts/recordGolden.mjs`) so the two can never drift apart. See
 * design/18-test-strategy.md (G1) for why this file exists at all:
 *
 * every determinism assertion in this repo before it built TWO runs in the same process and
 * compared them to each other. That catches nondeterminism and nothing else — change
 * `WALL_NORTH_BRIM`, `solidRadius`, `muzzleOffset` or the step order and both runs change
 * identically, so every one of those tests stays green while replay compatibility silently
 * breaks. A recorded hash is the only thing that notices, and noticing is the whole job: the
 * gate does not decide whether a change is allowed, it forces the ENGINE_VERSION decision to
 * be made deliberately instead of forgotten.
 *
 * ## Why the input script is integer-only
 *
 * `replay.test.ts`'s in-process scripts use `Math.sin(tick * 0.07)` to drive the stick, which
 * is fine when both sides of the comparison run on the same machine in the same second. It is
 * NOT fine for a fixture committed to git: `Math.sin` is not specified to be bit-identical
 * across JS engines or platforms, `quantizeMove` would land a boundary value on a different
 * brad on some other machine, and the hash would differ for a reason that has nothing to do
 * with the sim. `inputFor` below is a pure integer hash (`Math.imul` is exact 32-bit
 * everywhere), so the same tick yields the same command on every machine, forever.
