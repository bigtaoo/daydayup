/**
 * Step 14 — Win condition. PvE: no player "up" (all downed-or-dead) → enemies win;
 * last wave cleared with no enemies left → the (single) player wins. PvP (arena
 * mode, design/15 ROADMAP 4.2e): last SQUAD standing wins (design/05/15's squad
 * follow-up groups seats by `teamId`; a solo/FFA match is just every squad being a
 * singleton), with a finish order recorded as each squad is eliminated. Sets
 * state.winner + phase='gameover' once and emits a win event. After gameover the
 * orchestrator returns early and never re-enters here.
 *
 * Runs AFTER ReviveSystem (step 13, ROADMAP 3.2) so a completed revive / bleedout death
 * has already resolved this tick, and AFTER ExtractionSystem (step 12, ROADMAP 1.4/1.5): when `floorsEnabled`,
 * reaching wavesExhausted-with-no-enemies is a per-floor CHECKPOINT, not an
 * automatic win — ExtractionSystem owns that transition (EXTRACT/DESCEND), so this
 * system's wavesExhausted branch is skipped entirely for a floors-mode run. For
 * every config that predates 1.4 (floorsEnabled always false), this guard never
 * fires and behavior is byte-identical to before — additive, no ENGINE_VERSION bump.
 *
 * Ports Game.ts win()/lose() outcome logic; the menu/result shell (design/10)
 * stays render-side and is not the engine's concern.

   * Battle-royale placement (design/15), squad-aware (design/05/15's PvP squad
   * follow-up). Players are grouped by `teamId` into squads (a solo/FFA match is just
   * every squad being a singleton — the exact pre-squad behavior, unchanged). A squad
   * is eliminated once EVERY member is `!alive`; record every one of its seats (worst
   * place first) the tick that happens. When exactly one squad still has a living
   * member, that squad wins. The zero-surviving-squads case (two-or-more squads wiped
   * on the identical tick) is design/15's explicit same-tick tiebreak — deterministic,
   * never a coin flip: ascending `teamId` places higher.
   *
   * `state.winner`/the `'win'` event still carry a single representative SEAT index
   * (the winning squad's lowest seat index) — every consumer (`RunOutcome.ts`,
   * `replay.ts`, the HUD) already expects one seat number, and squad-mates share the
   * same outcome regardless of which one is named.
   *
   * NOTE: squad-mates eliminated together land at ADJACENT, not identical, numeric
   * placements (whichever order they're pushed within the batch) — full squad-tied
   * ranking would need `ladderReport.ts`'s per-seat rating math to become squad-aware
   * too, which is a deliberate follow-up, not done here (every other `placements`
   * consumer only cares about seat-index order, which this preserves exactly).
