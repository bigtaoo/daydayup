/**
 * Step 8b — room-id tracking (PvE + PvP) + PvP zone/hazard-tile damage (design/15,
 * ROADMAP 4.2d; generalized to dungeon mode design/05 "Room & door model",
 * 2026-08-04). AI enemies go through the identical check as players — no special-
 * casing needed for "does the zone kill monsters too," it just does.
 *
 * The `roomId`-tracking half now runs for EITHER co-resident mode (`zoneEnabled`
 * PvP, or `dungeonEnabled` PvE) — `DoorSystem`'s combat-lock/activation logic and
 * `SpawnSystem`'s per-room spawn dispatch both need a fresh `roomId` every tick,
 * same as PvP's zone/`EnvironmentSystem` always has. The zone/trait-damage half
 * stays strictly PvP-only (PvE has neither a `zone` nor `cellTraits`). Strict no-op
 * when NEITHER mode is enabled (every pre-4.2d config) — ExtractionSystem's
 * precedent for "an added step that doesn't bump ENGINE_VERSION" (GameEngine.ts).
 * Runs after `ZoneSystem` (this tick's `state.zone.safe` is current) and after
 * `StatusEffectSystem` — same global-tick-cadence placement as burn/poison
 * (design/15).
