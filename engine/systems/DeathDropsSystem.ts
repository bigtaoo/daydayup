/**
 * Step 9 — Death & drops. Any actor at hp<=0 dies (death event); a dead enemy

 * weapon pickup, tagged with this tick so the next step's Pickup pass can't
 * auto-vacuum it the same frame (design/08 note on ordering). Players don't drop.
 * Dead enemies are compacted out in place.

   * the first garrison and leave five rooms bare).
