/**
 * Step 1 — Apply input. Fold each player's confirmed command for this tick into
 * per-tick intent: move vector (fp/tick from moveBrad+moveMag), facing (see below —
 * no longer player input), the firing flag, and the edge-detected weapon-swap action.
 *
 * Facing (design/10, reversed-then-reversed-again 2026-08-03): there is no manual aim
 * input at all anymore. Every tick, a player faces the nearest hostile actor if one
 * exists (any distance — same unlimited-range contract `nearestHostile` already gives
 * homing/deflect), else the direction it's moving, else it holds last tick's facing
 * (idle default, same as before). Because this is engine-decided rather than fought
 * over with a manual aim input, it avoids the earlier "a locking bullet reads wrong"
 * failure mode that got the original auto-aim reverted.
 *
 * Idle default (design/08 open question, pinned here for Stage B): a player with
 * no command this tick holds idle — zero move, not firing — and its prevButtons is
 * left untouched so edge detection stays correct against the next real command.
 * Golden-replay coverage of this default is Stage E.
 *
 * Ports client/src/game/Game.ts updatePlayer() movement + facing, and
 * switchWeapon(), from float/radians to fp/brad. (Block is not a state — it is the
 * melee swing arc, see DeflectSystem; jump was removed.)
