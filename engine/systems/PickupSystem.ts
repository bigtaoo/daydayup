/**
 * Step 10 — Pickup. A player overlapping a collectable pickup applies it and the
 * pickup is consumed. Pickups dropped THIS tick are skipped (spawnTick guard) so a
 * kill in step 9 isn't vacuumed the same frame (design/08 ordering note). Collected
 * pickups are compacted out in place.
 *
 * Effects (design/05 the in-run power ramp):
 *   heal     — restore up to maxHp. Auto, on overlap — but ONLY while it would
 *              actually heal (`wouldApply`): a full-HP player walks over it and
 *              leaves it lying there to grab later. That is design/05's locked
 *              "consumables auto-apply, but only when useful" rule, which exists
 *              because there is no item bag to hold one in; it went unimplemented
 *              until `ENGINE_VERSION` 54, so the ONE item that restores the one
 *              pool nothing else restores was silently binned at full HP.
 *   material — added to this floor's un-banked buffer (state.floorMaterials,
 *              design/05, ROADMAP 1.4/1.5); banked at an extraction checkpoint
 *              (ExtractionSystem), forfeited on a run-ending death. Auto, on overlap.
 *   weapon   — design/03 "NOT auto-picked-up... click-driven" (ENGINE_VERSION 32,
 *              replacing v21's INTERACT gesture): overlap alone does nothing; the
 *              player must have clicked this exact item this tick (`pickupTargetId`
 *              matches the item's id — set by the render-side weapon-pickup panel,
 *              CommandBuilder.requestPickup) while within `SIM.lootRevealRadius` —
 *              wider than the tight overlap every other kind uses, since the panel
 *              already showed it from that range. Swaps it into the slot holding the
 *              same KIND of weapon (ENGINE_VERSION 46; `slotFor`) AND drops the
 *              outgoing weapon back onto the floor as a new pickup at the player's
 *              position (`applyWeapon`) — "no manual drop button," the drop is only
 *              ever a side effect of a swap.
 *   buff     — added to the run-scoped stack. Auto, on overlap.
 *   bandage  — PvP-arena-only (design/05/15's squad follow-up): +1 to the player's
 *              squad-revive currency, spent by ReviveSystem. Auto, on overlap.
 *   energy   — weapon-energy refill (design/03/05, ENGINE_VERSION 59): restore up to
 *              maxEnergy. Auto, on overlap, and under the SAME `wouldApply` gate `heal`
 *              is under, for the same reason — it is an instant item with no bag to
 *              hold it in, so a full player must leave it on the floor for later.
 *
 * Ports Game.ts updatePickups(): float px → fp, squared-distance overlap. The
 * render-only hover bob is dropped (visual, not sim).

/**
 * Would collecting `item` change `p`'s state at all? design/05's *"consumables —
 * auto-apply, but only when useful"*: with no item bag, an instant item collected at
 * full effect is destroyed for nothing, so the pickup radius must not trigger for it.
 *
 * **Only the two INSTANT items — `heal` and `energy` — have a condition, deliberately.**
 * `material`/`bandage` accumulate with no cap, so they always do something. `buff` looks like a candidate and is not one: the
 * `mult_*` families are Σ-then-clamped at USE time (`sumBuffs`, read by WeaponFire /
 * HitResolve), so "is this buff already at its cap" is not a question this call site can
 * answer without duplicating that arithmetic — and a run buff is a permanent stack entry,
 * not the "instant item" design/05's rule is about. `weapon` is click-driven and never
 * auto-collected in the first place. Any future instant item belongs here too — this is
 * the one place it needs a clause.
 *
 * Per-PLAYER, not per-item: it is called inside the player loop, so a full-HP teammate
 * standing on a heal does not block a hurt one from taking it on the same tick.
 *
 * **Exported because the `?pickupDebug=1` overlay has to agree with it.** That tool's whole
 * contract is "a green dot means the sim would collect this" (`PickupDebugOverlay.ts`), and
 * its own parity test runs the real `PickupSystem` beside the readout — so a second copy of
 * this predicate would be exactly the drift design/18's G6 is about. It called this out by
 * failing the moment the gate landed.
