/**
 * Step 9 — Pickup. A player overlapping a collectable pickup applies it and the
 * pickup is consumed. Pickups dropped THIS tick are skipped (spawnTick guard) so a
 * kill in step 8 isn't vacuumed the same frame (design/08 ordering note). Collected
 * pickups are compacted out in place.
 *
 * Effects (design/05 the in-run power ramp):
 *   heal     — restore up to maxHp. Auto, on overlap.
 *   material — added to this floor's un-banked buffer (state.floorMaterials,
 *              design/05, ROADMAP 1.4/1.5); banked at an extraction checkpoint
 *              (ExtractionSystem), forfeited on a run-ending death. Auto, on overlap.
 *   weapon   — design/03 "NOT auto-picked-up... click-driven" (ENGINE_VERSION 32,
 *              replacing v21's INTERACT gesture): overlap alone does nothing; the
 *              player must have clicked this exact item this tick (`pickupTargetId`
 *              matches the item's id — set by the render-side weapon-pickup panel,
 *              CommandBuilder.requestPickup) while within `SIM.lootRevealRadius` —
 *              wider than the tight overlap every other kind uses, since the panel
 *              already showed it from that range. Swaps it into the slot holding the
 *              same KIND of weapon (ENGINE_VERSION 46; `slotFor`) AND drops the
 *              outgoing weapon back onto the floor as a new pickup at the player's
 *              position (`applyWeapon`) — "no manual drop button," the drop is only
 *              ever a side effect of a swap.
 *   buff     — added to the run-scoped stack. Auto, on overlap.
 *   bandage  — PvP-arena-only (design/05/15's squad follow-up): +1 to the player's
 *              squad-revive currency, spent by ReviveSystem. Auto, on overlap.
 *
 * Ports Game.ts updatePickups(): float px → fp, squared-distance overlap. The
 * render-only hover bob is dropped (visual, not sim).

   *     overwriting the only weapon it has.
   *   - `p.activeSlot`, if both slots are the other kind. Not reachable through any shipped
