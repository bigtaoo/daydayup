/**
 * The melee ACTIVE HIT WINDOW (design/07 step 7, ENGINE_VERSION 53).
 *
 * ## What was broken, and what "green" used to mean
 *
 * `MeleeSpec.swingSec` was authored on all seven melee weapons from Stage C onward, documented
 * in `weaponTypes.ts` as the "ACTIVE hit-window (subset of cooldownSec), 07 step 7" and in
 * design/09's conversion table as `swingSec → swingTicks (active-hit window, 07)`. `toSimSpec`
 * never converted it, `MeleeSimSpec` had no field for it, and nothing in the repo read it.
 * `HitResolveSystem.meleeArc` resolved the whole arc on the single tick `justSwung` latched, so
 * every blade in the roster had a one-tick window regardless of what its own data said — the
 * hammer's authored 0.2 s and the spear's 0.1 s produced identical timing. 1104 engine tests
 * were green over that, because every one of them staged a swing by hand-latching `justSwung`
 * and asserting the hits that same tick, which is precisely the behaviour the one-tick bug
 * produces. This file is the half none of them tested: what happens on tick TWO of a swing.
 *
 * ## What each test here is actually pinning
 *
 * The failure mode to design against is a window test that passes against a ONE-TICK window —
 * assert a hit "during the swing" and a snapshot-on-the-swing-tick engine satisfies you.
 * So every test below either counts the ticks it observed, or proves the target was NOT
 * reachable on the swing tick before asserting it was reached later. A test that would pass
 * with `swingTicks: 1` is not testing this feature.
 *
 * ## Mutation battery — measured, not assumed (2026-09-02, ENGINE_VERSION 53)
 *
 * 21 mutants against the four source files this covers, whole engine suite per mutant, green
 * baseline before and after, every mutant reverted in a `finally`. **21/21 KILLED, no
 * survivors.** The count in brackets is how many tests died — a `(1 failing)` row is carried by
 * exactly one assertion, so deleting that test silently reopens the hole.
 *
 *   KILLED (6)   replay: drop swingTicksLeft from the hash
 *   KILLED (6)   replay: drop swingHitIds from the hash
 *   KILLED (6)   replay: drop swingDamage from the hash
 *   KILLED (6)   replay: drop spec.swingTicks from the melee branch
 *   KILLED (20)  spec: clamp every window to 1 tick (the pre-v53 behaviour)
 *   KILLED (14)  spec: window one tick too long
 *   KILLED (1)   spec: drop the min-1 clamp
 *   KILLED (1)   spec: drop the cooldown ceiling
 *   KILLED (8)   hitresolve: drop the once-per-swing hit-id guard
 *   KILLED (1)   hitresolve: re-roll the crit every active tick
 *   KILLED (2)   hitresolve: gate the arc on justSwung again (one-tick damage)
 *   KILLED (5)   deflect: gate the parry on justSwung again (one-tick parry)
 *   KILLED (2)   hitresolve: drop the alive/downed re-check
 *   KILLED (15)  weaponfire: never count the window down (permanently armed)
 *   KILLED (12)  weaponfire: count down twice as fast
 *   KILLED (3)   weaponfire: never clear the hit list when the window closes
 *   KILLED (4)   applyinput: leave a holstered blade armed mid-swing
 *   KILLED (1)   weaponfire: report a constant window on the event
 *   KILLED (1)   openSwing: drop the ranged guard
 *   KILLED (1)   openSwing: do not clear the hit list on restart
 *   KILLED (1)   closeSwing: reallocate the hit list instead of clearing it
 *
 * The four `replay:` rows are the point of the hash block below: before it, all four mutants
 * survived the ENTIRE repo, because `replay.ts`'s own comment is right that a golden-replay
 * comparison of two identical runs cannot see a missing field.
 *
 * **A harness trap worth recording, because it faked a clean sweep of CRASHED.** On Windows,
 * `subprocess.run(..., text=True)` decodes with cp1252, which cannot decode the box-drawing
 * characters vitest prints in FAILURE output. The reader threads die, `stdout`/`stderr` come
 * back EMPTY, and every genuinely-killed mutant is reported as a crash — the harness looks
 * conservative while telling you nothing. Pass `encoding='utf-8', errors='replace'`. The first
 * run of this battery reported 21/21 crashed for exactly that reason. See
 * [[daydayup-mutation-battery]].
 *
 * The other half is the guarantees the window must NOT break. A multi-tick window is a
 * multi-tick opportunity to deal damage repeatedly and to re-roll `combatPrng` per tick, and
 * design/07 locks both out ("each target is hit at most once per swing"; "a melee swing rolls
 * ONCE for the whole arc"). `once per swing, not once per tick` and `the crit is one draw for
 * the whole window` are the tests for those, and the golden fixture's own witness backs the
 * second one up independently: `prngCursors` is byte-identical across the v52→v53 re-record
 * while `deflect` counts rose, which is only possible if the window added zero draws.

/**
 * ── Second pass (same session): the gaps the block above left ──────────────────
 *
 * Everything above drives the two systems by hand, which is the right way to pin the
 * mechanic and the wrong way to know it is WIRED. Three things it cannot see, each of
 * which has its own history of going wrong in this repo:
 *
 *   1. The real `step()` order. A hand-driven `fire.tick(s); hits.tick(s)` pair proves the
 *      two systems agree with each other, not that the other eleven systems leave the
 *      window alone. `ENGINE_VERSION` 49 found a bug that was exactly this shape — the
 *      belief that a value is "corrected next tick" was false once the real order ran.
 *   2. Whether the new fields are actually in the replay hash. `replay.ts`'s own comment
 *      says the golden-replay test "compares two independent runs, so a new always-equal
 *      field never breaks it" — so adding a line to `serializeState` is UNTESTED by
 *      construction, and a typo'd or omitted field is invisible.
 *   3. The contracts on `openSwing`/`closeSwing` that no caller happens to exercise.
