/**
 * Step 3 — Weapon fire. For every actor whose fire flag is set and whose weapon
 * cooldown is ready: ranged spawns Projectile(s) at the muzzle; melee OPENS a swing —
 * `justSwung` latches the start tick and `swingTicksLeft` holds the spec's active hit
 * window open for `swingTicks` ticks (design/07 step 7, ENGINE_VERSION 53), which is what
 * HitResolve (step 7) re-tests its arc against and DeflectSystem (step 6) parries inside.
 * Both clocks — cooldown and window — count down here, in whole ticks. Runs BEFORE movement
 * (design/08) so a bullet spawns at this tick's muzzle, then everything moves.
 *
 * Ports RangedWeapon.use() / MeleeWeapon.use() and the enemy-fire block of
 * Game.ts updateEnemies(): float cos/sin → fp-trig, px → grid-fp.
 *
 * Emission (design/03 "orthogonal to ballistic", ROADMAP 1.1): `bullets` pellets
 * fire per trigger; for bullets > 1 each pellet's angle jitters within ±spreadHalf,
 * drawn from combatPrng (a single-pellet pinpoint shot draws nothing — the baseline
 * guns advance no new PRNG stream). The ballistic id + its params are frozen onto
 * each spawned Projectile, exactly like damageType (design/07 payload) — motion
 * (ProjectileStepSystem) and the beam's damage-over-window (HitResolveSystem) read
 * them from there, never re-reading the spec.
 *
 * Weapon energy (design/03/05, ENGINE_VERSION 59): a PLAYER's ranged pull is charged
 * `spec.energyCost` from its shared pool before anything is spawned, and refused
 * outright when the pool cannot cover it — with the cooldown left untouched, so the
 * trigger retries rather than burning a recovery on a shot that never happened. Melee
 * is free, which is what makes the always-owned melee half of the loadout the fallback
 * at empty. Enemies have no pool and are never charged. See `balance/energy.ts` for
 * why the price is indexed on the weapon's MECHANIC and how the numbers were measured.
