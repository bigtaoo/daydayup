/**
 * Step 2 — AI decide (both modes). Each enemy sets its own intent from state +
 * aiPrng: face the (first alive) player, close the distance toward it until
 * within gun range, then fire once actually in range; the weapon cooldown gates
 * the actual shot in WeaponFire. Enemies used to be fully stationary in the
 * slice (turn + shoot only, see ENGINE_VERSION_HISTORY.md v37) — reported as
 * "the AI doesn't move".
 *
 * Ports client/src/game/Enemy.ts tick() (atan2 facing + fire request), radians →
 * brad. The demo's `gx % 1` fire-phase jitter is replaced by an aiPrng-seeded
 * initial cooldown set in SpawnSystem — a real determinism fix.
 *
 * Fire-range gate (ENGINE_VERSION 40, design/05): a live player report — "the
 * instant I walk into a room, dozens of enemies gun me down before I can react"
 * — traced to `firing` being set unconditionally true the moment a room
 * activates, regardless of how far the enemy actually was from the player;
 * `engageRangeFp` only ever gated `chase()`'s stop-moving decision (v37), never
 * whether the mob was allowed to shoot. With level 1's hand-authored rooms
 * holding 15-30 enemies each (v38) and `ENEMY_GUN_SIM`'s bullet travel (~30
 * grid) comfortably covering a room's full diagonal, that meant every enemy in
 * an activated room opened fire on tick 1 no matter where it spawned — a
 * whole-room alpha strike with zero reaction time, the opposite of how a room
 * full of enemies plays in Soul Knight/Enter the Gungeon: enemies notice you
 * across the whole room (the room stays the aggro unit, unchanged), but only
 * the ones already close enough actually shoot; the rest have to visibly close
 * distance first, which is exactly the reaction window the report was missing.
 * Fixed: `firing` is now true only once the enemy is within its own
 * `engageRangeFp` (the same distance `chase()` already used to decide when to
 * stop closing) — "stop and shoot" is now literal instead of "shoot from
 * anywhere and also stop once close".
 *
 * Room fire budget (ENGINE_VERSION 41, design/05 "Room encounter budget"): the
 * v40 fix above turned out to buy only about half a second. `client/sim/
 * pveLevelSim.sim.ts` — a bot-driven level simulator written specifically to put
 * a number on the same recurring report — measured 14 of a 15-enemy room's mobs
 * firing on the same tick, a first hit 0.6s after activation, and death in ~2s
 * in 100% of runs at both bot skill profiles: enemies simply CLOSED to engage
 * range as one blob and opened up together, which the range gate does nothing
 * about. Two additions, both per-ROOM rather than per-mob, since the room is
 * already this game's aggro unit (design/05):
 *   - `grantFireSlots` — at most `ROOM_FIRE_BUDGET` (balance/encounter.ts) mobs
 *     per room may have `firing` set on a tick, awarded to the NEAREST
 *     contenders. The rest hold position in range with `firing` false, taking a
 *     slot as soon as a shooter dies or the player moves and reorders the queue.
 *   - `hasNoticed` — a freshly-activated room's mobs may move immediately but
 *     hold fire for a per-enemy staggered delay (`noticeDelayTicks`, derived
 *     from the enemy id, no PRNG draw), so entering a room is never an instant
 *     volley from whichever mobs were authored nearest the door.
 * `chaseAndEngage` no longer sets `firing` at all — it reports "in range" and
 * `grantFireSlots` is the single writer of `firing = true`.
 *
 * Perception radius (ENGINE_VERSION 42, live play report 2026-08-17 — "怪物的感知
 * 范围弄小一些"): room activation is the OUTER aggro gate and stays exactly as it was,
 * but a woken room's mobs now only react once the player is within their own
 * `aggroRangeFp` (`hasAggro`). Before this, activating a room set its entire garrison
 * — up to 14 mobs on level 1 — walking at the player from wherever they were authored,
 * so a room read as one converging blob rather than as a space with pockets of threat
 * in it. An un-noticed mob is fully inert: it does not move, fire, OR turn to face the
 * player. The flag is a one-way latch, so this is a wake-up trigger and never a leash.
 *
 * Room activation gate (design/05 "Room & door model", 2026-08-04): in dungeon
 * mode, an enemy whose room hasn't activated yet (no player has ever reached it)
 * runs NO decision logic at all — `firing`/`vx`/`vy` are simply left at whatever
 * they already were (false/0 for a freshly-spawned enemy, since `SpawnSystem`
 * never sets them), i.e. inert. This is the one and only place "AI behavior" is
 * gated, movement included.

   * 55) — and the reason "in range" is HYSTERETIC rather than a bare threshold: that spacing
   * pushes a standing mob outward, so a mob that stopped on the ring can be nudged just past
   * it, and a bare test would send it straight back into a chase-push-chase shuffle with its

   * the spot. The spot itself is placed `RING_MARGIN_STEPS` inside the engage range
   * (`approachSlots.ts`) precisely so that stopping a step short of it still leaves the mob
   * in range to shoot.
   *
   * The stop is NOT gated on being in range, unlike the one it replaces: a mob sent to an
   * outer ring by a crowded inner one has to be able to park there too. And a mob that is in
   * range but not yet at its spot keeps walking, sliding round the ring into place rather
   * than stopping in someone else's spot and waiting to be shoved out of it.
   *
   * ## Why an arrived mob has a much wider deadband than a walking one
   *
   * A spot is anchored to the target, so it MOVES when the player does — and with a single
   * one-step tolerance that turns every arrived mob into a mob that shadows the player step
   * for step at its engage range, which is a different game (and measurably a harder one:
   * `test:pve-sim` put the careful bot's average floor at 0.5 against 1.3 before this
   * deadband went in). Standing still is the behaviour v37 shipped and nothing in this pass
   * is meant to change it; what this pass changes is WHERE a mob stands, not whether it
   * stays there.
   *
   * So arrival is hysteretic, keyed off the mob's own current velocity — no new state field:
   * a mob that is already stopped and in range only sets off again once its spot has moved a
   * whole standing volume away (`standoffRadius`, ~30 px), while a mob already walking
   * carries on to within a step of it. A mob still out of range always closes, deadband or
   * not — that is the chase, and it is what `engageRangeFp` already bounds.
