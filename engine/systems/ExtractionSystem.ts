/**
 * Step 12 — Extraction (design/05, ROADMAP 1.4/1.5, PvE only). A complete no-op
 * unless `state.floorsEnabled` (EngineConfig.floors was provided) — every config
 * that predates this feature leaves it doing nothing, every tick, forever. That is
 * why this new step needed no ENGINE_VERSION bump when first added: it is exactly as
 * inert for an old config as the AABB wall-collision loops (ROADMAP 1.2) are when
 * state.walls is empty.
 *
 * The per-floor checkpoint is "this floor's waves are exhausted and no enemies
 * remain" (the same condition WinConditionSystem used to auto-win on when floors
 * are disabled — see its own floorsEnabled guard). At that point the run waits on
 * player 0's explicit portal-popup pick (single-player only; co-op's shared
 * decision is a Phase 3 concern) — CONFIRM_EXTRACT banks and ends the run,
 * CONFIRM_DESCEND banks and continues:
 *   - the LAST floor has no descend option (design/05 "the last floor's boss room
 *     IS its extraction room" — the boss fight was the challenge), so a
 *     CONFIRM_DESCEND press there is simply ignored; CONFIRM_EXTRACT still applies.
 *     This USED to auto-resolve EXTRACT the instant the capstone cleared, with no
 *     gesture at all — dropped (2026-08-12, live bug report: the boss's own death
 *     drops never had a chance to be picked up, since the run ended the same tick
 *     the boss died, before the player could walk over to them). The portal now
 *     opens and waits, exactly like every other floor's checkpoint, just without a
 *     Descend button — "walking through the portal after is automatic" now means
 *     the player chooses to walk up and confirm, not that the game does it for them.
 *   - any other floor offers the real choice via the same popup. This replaced an
 *     original hold-to-extract/tap-to-descend INTERACT gesture (design/10
 *     legibility fix, 2026-08-02: a render-side portal + explicit two-button choice
 *     reads far better than "hold E" — ROADMAP.md always flagged the hold/tap timer
 *     as a first-pass placeholder pending exactly this).
 *
 * Both resolutions bank state.floorMaterials into state.bankedMaterials (design/05
 * "materials so far are locked in" on descend; "keep materials" on extract) — a
 * run-ending DEATH never reaches here, so the floor buffer is simply never merged.
 *
 * That is only HALF the forfeit rule, and this comment used to name the wrong half
 * ("forfeit only this floor's un-banked buffer" — design/05's own locked wipe rule
 * is stricter, and had been since ROADMAP 3.2). `bankedMaterials` is not safe either:
 * it leaves the sim only when the CLIENT hands it to the meta layer, and
 * `RunOutcome.lose()` deliberately never does. So the shipped rule is **a death
 * forfeits the entire un-extracted carry-out**, both tiers, and the two-tier split
 * here is per-floor bookkeeping for the HUD — not a risk boundary. Nothing in this
 * file needs to change for that; the merge simply is not where the guarantee lives.
