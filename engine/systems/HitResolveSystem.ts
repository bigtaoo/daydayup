/**
 * Step 7 — Hit resolution. Hostile bullets that overlap cancel each other
 * (mutual destruction, resolved first so a cancelled bullet can't also hit an actor
 * this tick). Then bullet–actor overlap deals damage to any actor hostile to the
 * bullet (design/15 team model — no longer "the other array": a player's bullet
 * can hit a rival player, not just enemies) and consumes the bullet; a melee swing whose
 * ACTIVE window is open this tick (`swingTicksLeft > 0`, design/07 step 7) re-tests its arc
 * against every hostile actor in the sector, hitting each at most once for the whole swing.
 * Damage only lowers hp here — death is decided in step 9,
 * matching design/08's separation. The projectiles array is compacted in place at
 * the end, after clash/step/block/hit have all resolved.
 *
 * Every hit funnels through one resolver, `applyHit` (design/07 "one shared
 * resolver"): apply the target's per-type resist, subtract integer damage, then —
 * by the hit's DamageType — layer the on-hit status (burn/chill/poison) or arc to a
 * neighbour (lightning). The lingering DoT/chill is ticked later by
 * StatusEffectSystem (step 8); `applyHit` only *starts* the effect. All status math
 * is integer (design/06); the chain uses squared-distance nearest, no trig.
 *
 * Ports the hit branches of Game.ts updateBullets()/resolveMeleeHit(); radians →
 * brad, float px → fp, squared-distance overlap tests. Knockback / armor / i-frames
 * are design/07 and land later. (The demo's per-frame multi-hit melee is corrected
 * to once-per-swing, per design/07 — which is a different claim from once-per-TICK, and the
 * distinction is the whole point of `swingHitIds`: the swing spans several ticks now, and
 * the cap is per swing.)
