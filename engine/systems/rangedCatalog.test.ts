/**
 * Every RANGED weapon in the catalog, fired for real — the sweep the ranged half of the
 * roster did not have.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The mechanics were tested; the WEAPONS were not. `systems/ballistics.test.ts` covers each
 * ballistic shape once, through one showcase weapon per shape, and its integration block
 * names its seven weapons by hand. `systems/procs.test.ts` proves lifesteal / ricochet /
 * piercing on synthetic projectiles it builds itself, never on a spec out of
 * `WEAPON_SPECS`. So a weapon could author a field, have it convert correctly (that half is
 * `content/weapons.test.ts`'s), and still never be fired by anything.
 *
 * Counted across the whole test tree on 2026-09-04, `carom` — the game's ONLY ricochet
 * weapon — appeared in exactly one test file: `client/src/render/muzzleParity.test.ts`, a
 * render sweep. Its `ricochetCount: 2` had no test anywhere that put it on a projectile.
 * `venomspit` was in the same position.
 *
 * `systems/meleeWindow.test.ts` already sweeps `WEAPON_SPECS`'s melee half the right way
 * ("driven off WEAPON_SPECS itself rather than a hand-listed set, so a new blade is covered
 * the day it is authored"). This is the ranged counterpart, plus the two on-hit procs whose
 * shipped carriers no behavioural test touched.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * Four passes, all catalog-driven:
 *
 *   1. FREEZE   — one shot, and the whole payload on each pellet matches the spec it came
 *                 from, including that a weapon carries NO other shape's params.
 *   2. BEHAVE   — per ballistic, every shipped weapon of that shape moves per its OWN
 *                 authored numbers (so `frostseeker` is exercised beside `seeker`, and
 *                 `cinderscatter` beside `scattergun`, rather than one standing in for both).
 *   3. PROCS    — `carom`'s real `ricochetCount` bounces; `leech`'s real
 *                 `lifestealPermille` heals.
 *   4. PIPELINE — every ranged weapon, through the real `engine.step()`, damages an enemy
 *                 standing inside that weapon's OWN authored reach envelope.
 *
 * Every group assertion is guarded by a non-empty check on its own group, because a sweep
 * whose filter silently matches nothing is a green no-op (design/18).
 *
 * ## Mutation battery
 *
 * Recorded 2026-09-04 against `WeaponFireSystem.ts` / `ProjectileStepSystem.ts`. Every row
 * is a real edit, `npx vitest run systems/rangedCatalog.test.ts`, revert.
 *
 *   KILLED   `z: spec.bulletZ` → `toFp(0)` ......................................... 69
 *   KILLED   `radius: spec.bulletRadius` → `toFp(1)` ............................... 69
 *   KILLED   `ricochetsLeft: spec.ricochetCount` → `undefined` ....................... 2
 *   KILLED   `orbitAngularVelBrad` dropped from the spawn payload .................... 2
 *   KILLED   homing turn clamp widened (`b.turnRateBrad` → `· 4`) .................... 2
 *   KILLED   orbit steps at a constant radius instead of `b.orbitRadius` ............. 2
 *   KILLED   boomerang reverse moved one tick early ................................. 1
 *   KILLED   a landed lob dies instead of flagging `landed` .......................... 1
 *   SURVIVED `lifestealPermille: spec.lifestealPermille` → `undefined` .............. 0
 *   SURVIVED `beamDir` frozen to `a.facing` instead of the pellet `dir` ............. 0
 *
 * Both survivors are recorded rather than hidden, and both say something about the
 * CONTENT, not about the assertions:
 *
 *   - Lifesteal: no RANGED weapon in the catalog carries it (`leech` is melee, and melee
 *     lifesteal is read off the weapon spec in `HitResolveSystem`, never off a projectile).
 *     So the freeze sweep's lifesteal line compares `undefined` to `undefined` for all 17
 *     of them — a green assertion with nothing behind it. Pinned as its own named case
 *     below so it cannot stay quietly vacuous.
 *   - `beamDir`: every shipped beam weapon is single-pellet, so `dir === a.facing` and the
 *     two expressions agree on all real content. `WeaponFireSystem.test.ts` kills this one
 *     with a synthetic multi-pellet beam, which is the right place for it — a catalog sweep
 *     provably cannot.
