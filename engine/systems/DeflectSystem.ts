/**
 * Step 6 — Deflect (parry). Deflection is NOT a separate held state: it is part of
 * a melee swing. For each player whose melee swing is ACTIVE this tick (`swingTicksLeft > 0`
 * — the spec's `swingTicks` window, design/07 step 7, ENGINE_VERSION 53; it was the
 * one-tick `justSwung` latch before the window was wired) and whose spec has `deflect`,
 * any bullet HOSTILE to that player inside the swing's
 * sector (same `range` + `arcHalf` the damage uses) — design/15: no longer just
 * "enemy-faction," so a rival player's bullet can be parried too — flips to the
 * deflector's own team + faction and is redirected toward the nearest actor hostile
 * to the deflector (or mirror-forward along facing when none is in range), at the
 * weapon's deflect speed. Runs BEFORE hit resolution (design/08) so a just-deflected
 * bullet can't still damage the swinger this tick.
 *
 * design/03/05: parry is melee-only and lives inside the attack — swing at the
 * right moment and the arc that hits enemies also bats bullets back. No block key.
 *
 * The window is the SAME window HitResolve's arc damage uses, and deliberately so:
 * design/07 locks "the SAME arc both damages enemies and deflects bullets — there is no
 * separate `blockArc`", and an arc that damages for four ticks but parries for one is a
 * separate blockArc in everything but name. Gating both on one field is what keeps that
 * decision true in time as well as in shape. It does widen the parry window (one tick →
 * 3-6 by weapon), which is a real balance move on the pivot mechanic and not a free
 * refactor — design/05's "deflect is already a commitment" still holds, since the
 * commitment is the swing itself, and the frame-perfect timing this replaced was
 * unreadable at 30 Hz.
