// Whole ticks @30Hz. Shield regen is an idle timer, not a heal: after taking ANY
// damage an actor must stay unhit for DELAY ticks before shield refills +1 per
// INTERVAL, capped at maxShield. A DoT tick resets the timer (StatusEffectSystem),
// so clearing a lingering status is a precondition for regen.
export const SHIELD_REGEN_DELAY = 90; // ~3 s idle before regen starts
// ~2 s per +1 shield thereafter. Was 300 (~10 s) through ENGINE_VERSION 40, which
// made the shield pool effectively single-use in a PvE run: a character refills
// 3.2 shield in ~32 s of taking no damage at all, while a dungeon room takes ~8 s to
// clear and the next one is a few seconds' walk away — so a player entered a 37-enemy
// floor with one 9.2-point pool and no way to get any of it back except heal drops
// (`client/sim/pveLevelSim.sim.ts` measured the result: floor 1 cleared in 0% of bot
// runs even after the room garrisons were halved). 60 makes the two-pool split mean
// what design/07 says it means — shield is the RENEWABLE half, HP the permanent half
// that only a heal pickup restores — and makes disengaging between rooms a real
// tactic instead of a formality.

// ── Standing-wall north brim (design/01 height model, v47; widened v48) ───────────
/**
 * Extra clearance, in fp, between an actor and the NORTH face of a FREE-STANDING wall block
 * (`AABB.freeStanding`).
 *
 * **This exists because of how tall things are DRAWN, not because of what they are.** Everything
 * in this view is drawn upward from a grounded origin (`screen.y = gy - z`), so a standing block
 * paints its own footprint PLUS one full wall height of floor to its north
 * (`client/.../wallGeometry.ts`, `occlusion.ts`'s `Occluder.top`). How far an actor ends up
 * buried in that art is therefore `drawn height - clearance`, and until v47 the two standing
 * shapes in a room disagreed about it by a body's worth (a pillar sinking an actor 40 px, a wall
 * sinking the WHOLE silhouette at 54 px — see ENGINE_VERSION_HISTORY for that account). v47's
 * 16 px brim closed that gap (wall sink 70 - 32 = 38 px, matching the pillar's 40).
 *
 * **Widened from 16 to 23 px in v48** (live report, circled screenshot: *"角色被挡住的部分...大概
 * 当前角色的一半可以进入墙...改为1/4的位置"* — a free-standing block was still reading as burying
 * about half the character; wanted down to about a quarter). Wall sink against `WALL_H_INTERIOR`
 * drops from 38 to 31 px (`occlusion.test.ts`'s wall/pillar geometry assertion pins the new
 * number) — a real reduction, though **not** the full doubling a naive "half to a quarter" read
 * would suggest: 23 px is not a target, it is a CEILING. `launchArena.test.ts`'s "what the north
 * brim costs the launch map" suite rasterizes the shipped arena's standable floor with and without
 * the brim and asserts the two connect the same rooms into the same regions — at 24 px one of the
 * map's single-grid-cell gaps stops fitting a player and a route seals; 23 is the largest value
 * that still measures zero lost routes there. Widening further needs the room/kit geometry itself
 * loosened (more spacing around a free-standing block), not just this constant. `solidRadius`
 * itself was deliberately left alone — widening THAT floats a character off a wall's east/west
 * face, which v43 tuned to land exactly tangent.
 *
 * **This constant does not touch every case a character can read as "sunk into a wall."** It only
 * ever applies to a FREE-STANDING block's north face — see "Only free-standing blocks" below. The
 * shipped floors' worst-case occlusion sample (`occlusionCoverage.test.ts`, 43.75%) is a position
 * no block's `occludes()` rule fires for at all (just under `MIN_COVER_FRACTION`) and is untouched
 * by this widening; a screenshot of a character against a room's own boundary wall or a kerb is a
 * different case than the one this constant governs.
 *
 * **Only free-standing blocks.** A perimeter wall must keep exact-footprint collision: its ring
 * is what door passages are carved through (`carveDoorGaps`) and a brim on it would narrow every
 * passage from both sides, and a room's SOUTH boundary is drawn as a 22 px kerb
 * (`WALL_H_KERB`) whose whole purpose is that an actor CAN stand tangent to it — brimming that
 * would re-open the v43 report ("角色...感觉陷进去了") from the opposite side, floating the
 * character off a lip that was never covering them.
 *
 * **Since v48 this also governs where a dropped pickup may land** (`geom.clampToWalkable`): a
 * point clamped only against a free-standing block's bare footprint could settle inside this same
 * brimmed band — on screen, but past where any actor's own `solidRadius` will ever let them stand
 * (live report: *"角色根本无法拾取掉落的物品"*). `clampToWalkable` now pushes a point out of the
 * brimmed top edge exactly like `MovementSystem.resolveWalls` does for a live actor.
