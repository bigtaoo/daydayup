/**
 * `ENGINE_VERSION` — bumped whenever a change to the deterministic core could make
 * an old recorded input stream diverge (system reorder, fp/brad/table change, new
 * PRNG draw site). design/08: `ReplayInputSource` refuses a mismatched version —
 * fail loud, never replay garbage.
 *
 * The full per-bump history (why every bump from v2 onward happened, and the handful
 * of changes that shipped WITHOUT a bump because they were additive/inert for every
 * existing config) lives in ./ENGINE_VERSION_HISTORY.md, not here — it is well over
 * a thousand lines of prose, not code, so a `.ts` doc-comment was never the right
 * place for it (CLAUDE.md "500-line file convention": this was a
 * documentation-placement problem, not one the split-priority list's forms actually
 * address). Originally split out of config.ts as a same-shape `.ts` file (form ①,
 * independent data module); moved to Markdown the same day once that file itself
 * hit 505 lines.
