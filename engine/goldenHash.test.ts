/**
 * The golden-hash gate (design/18-test-strategy.md, G1 / Layer 0).
 *
 * ## What this catches that `replay.test.ts` cannot
 *
 * `replay.test.ts` is excellent at what it does — but every one of its assertions builds two
 * runs IN THE SAME PROCESS and compares them to each other. That proves the engine is
 * deterministic. It cannot prove the engine still does what it did yesterday, because a
 * behaviour change moves both runs identically. `replay.ts`'s own comment says so, as the
 * reason a field was safe to add: *"the golden-replay test compares two independent runs, so a
 * new always-equal field never breaks it."*
 *
 * So before this file, changing `WALL_NORTH_BRIM`, an actor's `solidRadius`, a weapon's
 * `muzzleOffset`, or the `step()` order left the entire 885-test engine suite green while
 * silently breaking replay compatibility with every recorded stream in the wild. The
 * `ENGINE_VERSION` bump that is supposed to catch that was a human habit backed by nothing.
 *
 * ## What a failure here means
 *
 * It is NOT "you broke something". It means the sim's observable behaviour moved, and that is
 * a decision, not an accident to be papered over:
 *
 *   - **Intended?** Bump `ENGINE_VERSION` in `versionHistory.ts`, add a `## vN:` entry to
 *     `ENGINE_VERSION_HISTORY.md` saying what diverges and why, then `npm run record:golden`.
 *   - **Unintended?** You just found a real regression, in the cheapest possible way.
 *
 * The recorder is deliberately a separate command rather than a `-u` flag: re-recording should
 * cost a conscious keystroke, because the whole value of this file is that it is annoying to
 * dismiss. `versionContract.test.ts` closes the loophole of re-recording without bumping.
 *
 * ## Why the witness is asserted too
 *
 * A hash says a number moved. `witness` says which way the world moved (enemies alive, shots in
 * flight, floor index, summed PRNG cursors), so a red gate is diagnosable from the diff alone —
 * and, just as important, a scenario that quietly stopped spawning anything cannot go on
 * "passing" its hash while testing an empty room. The `assertScenarioDidSomething` block is the
 * anti-vacuity guard the `*Coverage.test.ts` suites already use (`expect(pairs)
 * .toBeGreaterThan(50)`), applied to a whole run.
 *
 * ## Mutation battery — what this gate is measured to catch, and what it is not
 *
 * Recorded 2026-08-30 at ENGINE_VERSION 48. Re-run it after adding or retuning a scenario; a
 * gate whose kills are assumed rather than measured is the failure mode this whole file exists
 * to prevent.
 *
 *   KILLED   WALL_NORTH_BRIM 23px -> 24px .......................... 1 failing test
 *   KILLED   enemy solidRadius: bp.radius -> bp.footprintRadius ..... 4
 *   KILLED   starter muzzleGrid 0.9375 -> 1.0 ...................... 7
 *   KILLED   step order: deflect <-> hitResolve ..................... 2
 *   KILLED   step order: weaponFire <-> movement ................... 9
 *   SURVIVED step order: statusEffect <-> zone
 *   SURVIVED step order: movement <-> projectileStep
 *   SURVIVED step order: deathDrops <-> pickup
 *
 * The three survivors are all reorderings of systems that never interact WITHIN these
 * scenarios — no bullet in the set happens to depend on whether its shooter moved first, and no
 * drop is ever collected on the tick it spawns. They are honest coverage gaps, recorded rather
 * than papered over: this gate is strong on constants and content, partial on step order. If
 * step-order coverage matters more later, the fix is a denser scenario (simultaneous
 * melee+drop+pickup in one tick), not a wider sweep of the existing ones.
 *
 * The first version of `WALL_NORTH_BRIM`'s row above read SURVIVED, against four scenarios built
 * from shipped content. That is what produced `fixtures/brimGrinderFloor.ts` — read its header
 * before assuming a scenario exercises what its name suggests.

/**
 * A scenario that ends on tick 3, or wanders an empty room for 1500 ticks, still produces a
 * perfectly stable hash — and pins nothing. This block is what stops the suite above from
 * being a very elaborate way to compare two constants.
 *
 * The measure is EVENT COUNTS, not PRNG cursors. `Prng.peek()` returns the LCG's internal
 * state, ~1e10 on a fresh engine, so the obvious-looking `prngCursors > 1000` guard is true
 * before a single tick runs — it was in the first draft of this file and proved nothing. What
 * the engine emits per tick is the honest signal.
 *
 * Bounds are deliberately loose and one-sided: they say "a real game happened", not "the
 * balance is X", so ordinary tuning never trips them while a scenario collapsing into a no-op
 * always does.
