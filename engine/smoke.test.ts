/**
 * Whole-engine smoke: real runs, invariants checked EVERY tick
 * (design/18-test-strategy.md, Layer 3).
 *
 * ## Why this exists alongside 900-odd unit tests
 *
 * A unit test can encode the same wrong assumption as the code it tests and pass anyway. This
 * repo has that written down twice over — `shield.test.ts` read its expectation from the very
 * constant it was guarding, and the 16 px wall runs shipped past a level-1 content suite where
 * every INPUT gate was green, because the defect was born in the transform between them.
 *
 * The defence is to assert on properties of a real run instead of on scenarios. An invariant
 * like "no actor is ever inside a wall" cannot be satisfied by a mistaken assumption; it is
 * either true of every tick of every scenario or it is not. That is a different kind of claim
 * from anything in `systems/*.test.ts`, and it is the kind that catches the bug nobody
 * predicted — which is the whole reason the two reports behind design/18 (a character buried in
 * a wall, a drop that could not be picked up) reached a human before they reached a test.
 *
 * ## Relationship to the golden gate
 *
 * `goldenHash.test.ts` asks "did behaviour CHANGE". This asks "is behaviour CORRECT". They fail
 * for opposite reasons and neither substitutes for the other: a wrong-but-stable engine passes
 * the golden gate forever, and a deliberate retune fails it while every invariant here holds.
 * The scenarios are shared (`fixtures/goldenScenarios.ts`) so the two always describe the same
 * runs.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * The full set is ~4,700 ticks across five scenarios with a per-tick check over every actor,
 * bullet and pickup. It runs in well under a second, so it stays in the default `npm test`
 * rather than joining the opt-in `.sim.ts` tier.

/**
 * How far an actor may be inside a wall before it counts as a breach.
 *
 * One fp unit — a tolerance for the push's own `Math.trunc` residue and nothing more. It was
 * 200 until ENGINE_VERSION 49, as a MEASURED allowance for a real shipping behaviour this file
 * found: `MovementSystem` resolved walls before `resolveActorPairs`, so a pair shove was the
 * last thing in a tick and could push an actor back into stone. The tradition around that
 * ordering said it was "corrected on the following tick", and for a glancing shove it was — but
 * two bodies pinned together against a wall re-applied the shove every tick, so the wall pass
 * never got the last word and the pair reached a stable standoff INSIDE the wall. Measured on
 * `launch-arena-pvp`: one episode of 103 consecutive ticks (~3.4 s at 30 Hz) at up to 189 fp,
 * a full 6 px of body buried in stone — the same order as the v47/v48 reports that produced
 * design/18.
 *
 * `MovementSystem.reseparateFromSolids` (v49) re-runs the solid passes after the pair push, so
 * the allowance is back to being about rounding. The trade is explicit and is the right way
 * round per design/07: two actors may now overlap each other slightly more than the pair push
 * intended, because a solid gets the final say over a body.
