/**
 * Sim tuning — the cross-cutting simulation constants that are neither weapon nor

 * players.ts / enemies.ts); the drop table + heal amount moved to content/drops.ts
 * in Stage F. What remains here is the wave-director cadence and the
 * projectile/pickup padding.
 *
 * SPATIAL UNIT (Stage C): grid — 1 fp = 1/1000 grid, 1 grid = 32 px. Ported
 * Stage-B px paddings cross via pxToFp (÷32). Any change here that alters outcomes
 * bumps ENGINE_VERSION.
