 * (design/06 "two hand-mirrored copies inevitably drift"): the transport shapes are
 * shared source, not re-declared per side.
 *
 * Unlike funny (which ships opaque `game.proto` bytes the server never decodes),
 * DayDayUp's `PlayerCommand` is already a compact plain-data record (integer
 * brad/mag/buttons — state/commands.ts), so it travels on the wire verbatim. The
 * server still never interprets a command's MEANING; it only buckets commands by
 * frame and broadcasts them (design/06 "server as frame broadcaster").
 *
 * Frame numbering matches the engine: frame 0 is the initial state (no commands ever
 * apply to it); real sim frames start at 1 (GameEngine.advance(frame), frame=tick+1).
