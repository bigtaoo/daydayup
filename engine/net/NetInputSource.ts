/**
 * Online co-op input source (design/06 "NetInputSource", ROADMAP 3.1) — the networked
 * sibling of LocalInputSource / ReplayInputSource, all implementing InputSource
 * (state/commands.ts). It bridges the server's frame-broadcast metronome (design/06)
 * to the deterministic engine:
 *
 *   • OUTBOUND — `submit(cmd)` relays the local seat's command to the server (via the
 *     injected sink), but only when it CHANGED since the last one sent (design/15,
 *     ROADMAP 4.5 sparse input sync — see the class doc below `changed()`). It does
 *     NOT choose a frame: the server schedules it onto the current batch window and
 *     broadcasts it back. The command becomes CONFIRMED only when it returns inside a
 *     `frame_batch`.
 *
 *   • INBOUND — `frame_batch{toFrame, frames}` raises the confirmed watermark. Since
 *     an unchanged command is never resent, a boundary frame with nothing NEW from a
 *     given seat does NOT mean that seat went idle — it means "still doing what it
 *     was doing" (design/15's "held input" model). `take(frame)` releases, for each
 *     owner that has ever sent anything, either this frame's fresh command or its last
 *     held one — or `null` when the frame is not yet confirmed, which stalls the
 *     engine (design/06: "clients advance strictly by the confirmed frame stream").
 *
 * Pacing / jitter cushion (design/06 catch-up model): playback is held `bufferFrames`
 * behind the newest watermark, so jitter smaller than the cushion never starves the
 * sim. When the watermark jumps ahead (a burst, or a `conn_resync` after reconnect),
 * `confirmedLead()` reports the backlog and the render loop's accumulator fast-forwards
 * to resync — "a lagging client falls behind the broadcast and catches up alone."
 *
 * This is the confirmed-stream half. LOCAL PREDICTION of the local seat (running ahead
 * of the watermark with self-forwarded input, then reconciling) is a separate layer on
 * top — see the prediction driver (ROADMAP 3.1 part D). Co-op PvE is latency-tolerant
 * (design/06), so it is playable on this source alone; prediction is the twin-stick
 * feel fix that matters most for PvP.
 *
 * Sparse held-input sync (design/15, ROADMAP 4.5) is a WIRE-FORMAT change only — the
 * engine still receives one full command per player for every simulated tick
 * internally (a gap is filled by holding, right here), so nothing about
 * `@dd/engine`'s determinism or ENGINE_VERSION moves; this class is the only place
 * that changes. It's deliberately the SAME hold-then-reconcile consumption pattern
 * `LocalPredictor` already uses for the local seat's own rendering, so a future move
 * to full state-sync only swaps what arrives sparsely, not how it's consumed.
