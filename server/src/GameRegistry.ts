/**
 * `GameRegistry` (ROADMAP 8.6, design/19 §6) — which gameserver a freshly issued seat
 * ticket should be redeemed against.
 *
 * The gameserver's rooms are in-process `Map`s driven by in-process intervals
 * (`RoomManager.ts`), so today there can be exactly one instance. That is fine — a
 * frame-broadcast room is inherently a stateful shard — but it was an *accident* rather
 * than a decision, and the cheap moment to shape it is before anything depends on
 * `/find`'s response format. So this class exists now with the whole shape (register,
 * heartbeat, pick-least-loaded, staleness) and only ONE branch actually reachable: the
 * statically configured single instance. `register`/`heartbeat` have no HTTP route yet.
 *
 * Two rules from design/19 §6 are the *shape* of this class rather than implementation
 * detail, which is why they are written down here and not left for the next person to
 * re-derive when they add the routes:
 *
 *  1. **A single-instance deployment does not register at all.** A configured static
 *     address (`DDU_GAMESERVER_URL`) supplies one entry. That is why `pick()` has a
 *     fallback arm at all, and why the fallback is held SEPARATELY from `entries`
 *     rather than seeded into the map as a competing entry: nothing reports load or
 *     liveness for a configured address, so as a map entry it would sit at load 0 and
 *     never go stale, and would therefore win every `pick()` against real instances
 *     reporting real numbers. A fallback that outcompetes the thing it is a fallback
 *     for is not a fallback.
 *
 *  2. **When registration is built: retry indefinitely with capped backoff, give up
 *     immediately on a 4xx, and never re-register from a heartbeat.** Each half has a
 *     failure it exists to prevent. A 4xx is a configuration or authentication error,
 *     so retrying it just hides a deployment mistake behind an instance that never
 *     appears; anything else is a network blip, and giving up on one would leave a
 *     healthy instance permanently invisible. And a heartbeat that silently
 *     re-registered would mask a failed startup registration — which is why
 *     `heartbeat()` below returns `false` for an unknown id and writes nothing.
 *
 * The chosen URL travels in `/find`'s RESPONSE, never inside the ticket: `ticket.ts`
 * stays purely a seat authorization and never learns the topology. (design/19 §6
 * supersedes the earlier "put a gameserver id inside the ticket" sketch.)
