/**
 * PvP practice-bot runner (design/15 follow-up, Matchmaker.ts's `onBotFill`). When a
 * PvP queue bot-fills after sitting `pvpBotFillMs` without enough real players, matchsvc
 * spawns one of these per empty seat. It redeems a ticket and opens the gameserver
 * socket EXACTLY like a real player's browser tab would (same ticket-authenticated `/ws`
 * handshake, same `join`/`cmd`/`result` wire messages) — MatchRoom/RoomManager need no
 * bot concept at all, because a bot connection is byte-for-byte the same shape as a
 * human one.
 *
 * It drives a real headless `CoopSession` off the server's confirmed frame stream (full
 * determinism, no shortcuts — the engine can't tell a bot from a remote player, design/08)
 * and picks its own commands via `PvpBotController` (fight the nearest living opponent,
 * hold position otherwise). `buildPvpEngineConfig` (client/src/game/pvpConfig.ts) is the
 * SAME function `Game.buildOnlineConfig` calls for a real player's pvp branch, so the
 * bot's engine is byte-identical to every human client's (design/06 anti-drift).
 *
 * Known limitation (accepted, not solved here): if a bot's socket drops mid-match, this
 * seat behaves exactly like a disconnected real player — MatchRoom pauses the metronome
 * waiting for a reconnect (co-op/PvP are both latency-tolerant) rather than forfeiting.
 * There is no bot reconnect logic; a dropped bot stalls the match same as a dropped human
 * would, an existing accepted tradeoff this feature doesn't change.
