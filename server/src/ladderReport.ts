/**
 * The dedupe key for one settled match: `{roomId}:{16 hex of sha256 over the report}`.
 *
 * WHY roomId, and why it is not enough ON ITS OWN. A room settles at most once —
 * `MatchRoom.reportResult` latches `this.settled` and destroys the room immediately after
 * firing `onSettled` — and `matchsvc.ts` mints room ids with `randomUUID()`, so in
 * production one roomId names exactly one settlement and `roomId` alone would be a correct
 * key. The mode does not change that: a PvE/co-op settlement travels the SAME
 * `onSettled` → `reportSettledMatch` path and is filtered only by that function's
 * `hashOk`/`placements`/`winner` guard, but the filter is per-REPORT, so whatever gets
 * through still gets through once per room.
 *
 * What breaks it is the room id not always being ours. `index.ts`'s legacy dev handshake
 * (no `DDU_TICKET_SECRET` configured) takes `roomId` straight off the query string, and the
 * room is destroyed when it settles — so a local `?roomId=dev` can host a second, genuinely
 * different match, and a roomId-only key would silently swallow every settlement after the
 * first. That failure is the one the tests below care about most: double-crediting a match
 * is visible and reversible, while a match whose rating never lands is neither.
 *
 * The room id appears TWICE — as the prefix and inside the digest — and the second is
 * redundant while the first is intact (a mutation battery on 2026-09-05 confirmed it:
 * dropping `roomId` from the digest kills nothing, dropping the prefix kills four cases).
 * It is kept as the cheaper half of the pair to lose: the prefix exists for humans reading
 * SQL and could reasonably be shortened or normalised one day, and if it is, the digest is
 * what keeps two rooms apart.
 *
 * So the content digest rides along. It costs nothing to compute, it is a pure function of
 * the report (the SAME body a retry re-sends, so the key is stable across the retry ladder
 * — which is the one property the whole mechanism rests on), and it separates two matches
 * that share a room id unless their accounts, places AND teams are all identical, at which
 * point the two reports are indistinguishable anyway.

 * (index-aligned across all three). `placements[j]` (0-indexed) is place `N - j`,
 * where `N` = `playerCount` — the FIRST-eliminated seat is the WORST place.
 *
 * `playerCount` (the true total seat count) is a REQUIRED param, not derived from
 * `placements.length + 1` — that inference is only correct for a solo/FFA match.
 * `WinConditionSystem.tickPlacement` (engine) only ever pushes LOSING squads' seats
 * into `placements`; the winning squad's OTHER members (everyone but the single
 * `winner` seat `state.winner` names) never appear in `placements` OR `winner`, so a
 * squad win with a real playerCount would silently drop them from the ladder report
 * entirely without this param. With it, every seat sharing the winner's `teamId`
 * (`teamIdForOwner`, same formula the engine used to assign teams) is filled in as
 * tied for 1st — the "full squad-tied ranking" design/15 flagged as a follow-up.
 * A solo/FFA match (squad size 1) has the winner's team be just the winner seat
 * itself, reproducing the exact pre-squad single-winner behavior.
 *
 * `accountId` falls back to a SCAFFOLD (`seat:{roomId}:{seatIdx}`) for any seat with no
 * real account behind it — a guest, a bot, or (pre design/16-accounts.md) every seat,
 * since this project had no account/auth layer anywhere before that. `seatAccounts`
 * (optional last param) is `MatchRoom`'s per-seat real accountId map, threaded from the
 * signed ticket a logged-in player redeemed; omitting it (every pre-account caller)
 * reproduces the exact old scaffold-only behavior.
