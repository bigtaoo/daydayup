/**
 * The billing plane's OWN SQLite file (design/19-server-platform.md §4). Deliberately
 * separate from `db.ts`'s account database, and deliberately not sharing its `openDb`:
 * "Money gets its own process and its own database file" is a locked decision in that
 * doc, and a shared opener is exactly how a later refactor quietly re-merges them.
 *
 * Same `node:sqlite` shape as `db.ts` (no native driver on this box), same synchronous
 * single-file zero-ops posture. Six tables — four for the money, two for the operations
 * around it:
 *
 *   orders    one row per purchase attempt. `platform_txn_id`'s UNIQUE constraint is the
 *             schema-level guarantee that no two orders can claim one platform payment.
 *   receipts  one row per verified receipt, keyed `${platform}:${receipt}`, and carrying
 *             the `product` the receipt RESOLVED to — without that column a receipt for
 *             one SKU can be replayed to claim a different one (design/19 §4).
 *   ledger    append-only. Never UPDATEd, never DELETEd. A reversal is a new row with
 *             `kind = 'reversal'`, which is what makes the file hand-auditable with SQL
 *             instead of needing the admin service design/19 §8 declines to build.
 *   deliveries the OUTBOX (design/19 §4's closed loop). One row per settled purchase that
 *             owes the control plane an `entitlements` write, inserted inside the same
 *             `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` as its `orders`/`receipts`/`ledger` siblings and drained
 *             afterwards over HTTP. Four tables, not three, and the fourth is the whole
 *             reason the single-transaction claim survives a table in another file.
 *   webhook_events  design/19 §7's first operational requirement: EVERY platform callback,
 *             not just the one that settled. Keyed `${txnId}:${eventType}` and upserted,
 *             because platform redelivery is at-least-once.
 *   review_queue    design/19 §7's "files rather than acts". The one place a human is told
 *             that something needs looking at, and deliberately append-with-a-claim rather
 *             than a log line: a console line has no owner and no second reader.
 *
 * SIX tables, then, and the last two are the operational half rather than the money half.
 * `review_queue` in particular holds findings about the CONTROL PLANE's `entitlements`
 * table, which lives in another file — on purpose. billsvc is the plane with the audit
 * posture, its file is the one an operator already opens with `sqlite3` when money is the
 * question, and the delivery pump (which produces the "money taken, nothing granted" kind)
 * has this connection and no other. A second queue in the account file would mean a human
 * has to know which of two places to look.
 *
 * No foreign keys point at `accounts(id)`, and none can: that table lives in a different
 * database FILE. The account-side integrity check is design/19 §2's `entitlements` table
 * in the control plane, reached through `BillingService`'s injected delivery seam rather
 * than through SQL.
