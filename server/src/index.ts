/**
 * gameserver bootstrap (design/06, ROADMAP 3.1) — the co-op frame-broadcast data plane.
 * The ONLY file that touches the socket layer: it wraps each WebSocket as a
 * RoomConnection and provides the real-timer Scheduler, then hands everything to the
 * pure RoomManager / MatchRoom lifecycle (which the tests drive with fakes).
 *
 * Handshake (ROADMAP 3.3): a client connects with a signed ticket — `/ws?ticket=<token>`
 * — issued by the matchmaking control plane (matchsvc.ts). The gameserver derives the
 * trusted `{roomId, owner, seed, playerCount}` from the VERIFIED ticket, never from raw
 * query params, so a client can no longer claim another seat or a different seed.
 * A real `DDU_TICKET_SECRET` makes a valid ticket mandatory (invalid/absent → 4401);
 * with no secret set (pure local dev) the legacy raw-param handshake
 * (`/ws?roomId=..&owner=..&seed=..&count=..`) is still accepted for manual testing.
 *
 * Wire format: newline-free JSON per message (ClientMsg in, ServerMsg out). PlayerCommand
 * is already compact plain data, so JSON is fine for the co-op MVP; a WeChat/production
 * build would swap in a binary codec behind this same seam.

 * How hard the gameserver tries to land a settlement report (design/19 §3, ROADMAP 8.1).
 * A settlement is the retryable kind of call: it happens exactly once per match, nothing
 * re-sends it, and a lost one silently costs real players the rating they just earned —
 * the opposite of a periodic heartbeat, which passes no `retry` because the next tick is
 * already the retry.
 *
 * The budget used to be 3, and the note here used to explain that the ceiling was low
 * because `/rating/report` was at-least-once against a receiver with no dedupe key, so a
 * delivered-but-unacknowledged report double-applied on retry — 8.1's one open item.
 * That is closed: the report now carries `ladderReport.ts`'s `reportKey`, and matchsvc
 * claims it in `rating_reports` inside the same transaction that moves the ratings
 * (`RatingStore.applyMatchOnce`). A redelivery loses the claim and comes back 200 with
 * `duplicate: true`, which ends the ladder rather than being counted a failure.
 *
 * So the trade this constant expresses changed shape. Retrying can no longer multiply a
 * rating; what it still costs is one in-flight request per attempt against a peer that may
 * be struggling. 5 attempts at 250/500/1000/2000/2000 ms is ~3.75 s of backoff plus up to
 * 5 x `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` — enough to ride out a matchsvc restart, still bounded, and
 * still fire-and-forget so no match waits on it.
 *
 * Exported so `index.lifecycle.test.ts` can assert the give-up point against the real
 * budget instead of a copy of the number, which is the part that must not drift.

/**
 * Report a settled match's placements to matchsvc's ladder (design/15, ROADMAP 4.6) —
 * ONLY when the room was a PvP room (`mode`) AND the result was checkpoint/hash-verified
 * (`hashOk`); every PvE/co-op settlement is silently skipped, same as it always was
 * before 4.6 existed. The placement→rank conversion lives in `ladderReport.ts` (pure,
 * unit-tested).
 *
 * `mode` is the arm that has to come first, and it is the one that was missing until
 * 2026-09-05. The other three are all necessary but only one of them is TRUSTED:
 * `hashOk` is the room's own comparison of the seats' hashes, while `placements` and
 * `winner` are relayed verbatim off the seats' `result` messages. Gating "was this PvP?"
 * on `placements` being present therefore asked the players — a co-op squad that agrees
 * on a hash and all send a fabricated `placements` array plus a numeric `winner` moved
 * real accounts' ratings off a match nobody competed in. `SettledMatch.mode` comes from
 * the verified ticket via `MatchRoom.modeValue`, which no seat can author; `placements`
 * and `winner` stay in the guard because `buildRatingReportBody` needs both to be
 * well-formed, not as evidence of what kind of match this was.
 *
 * Goes through `internalFetch` rather than a bare `fetch` — design/19's D2, and the one
 * call in this process that had the defect. The old shape was
 * `fetch(...).catch(() => {})`, which never consumed the response body: funny shipped
 * that exact line and measured it wedging undici's keep-alive pool under a concurrent
 * burst so that NO report arrived, for ~30 s at a time, with nothing logged either way.
 * Three things change: the body is always drained, the attempt has an explicit timeout
 * (undici's `fetch` has none), and a transient failure is retried — see
 * `SETTLEMENT_RETRY` for why bounded. It stays fire-and-forget: settlement never awaits
 * the ladder, and `internalFetch` never rejects, so there is no unhandled rejection to
 * take the gameserver down mid-match. What it no longer does is fail SILENTLY.
 *
 * The body carries `reportKey` (`ladderReport.ts`), which makes the retry above safe: a
 * redelivered report loses matchsvc's dedupe claim and is answered 200, so the ladder stops
 * on the first attempt that reaches an already-applied settlement instead of applying it
 * again. Nothing here has to check for that — a 200 is a 200 — which is the point of
 * putting the marker in the body and not in the status.
 *
 * `opts` is a test seam (the same role `GameserverOptions` plays for `createGameserver`) —
 * production passes nothing and gets the real `fetch`, the real timers and the real key.
