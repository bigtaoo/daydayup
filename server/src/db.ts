/**
 * Account/session/rating/meta persistence (design/16-accounts.md). Uses Node's built-in
 * `node:sqlite` (stable since Node 22) rather than a third-party driver — this box has no
 * C++ build toolchain for native modules like better-sqlite3, and the built-in module needs
 * nothing beyond the Node runtime already required to run this server at all. Same
 * synchronous, single-file, zero-ops shape the rest of this project already leans on (no
 * Express, no separate DB service — see matchsvc.ts/RatingStore/PartyService).

-- Server-owned ownership of the purchasable half of MetaState (design/19 §2, ROADMAP 8.2;
-- logic in EntitlementService.ts). meta_state above keeps what the client legitimately
-- authors and stays a blob; blueprint/character ownership moves here, because a whole-blob
-- upsert is a free-money hole once those are sold.
--
-- This table DOES take the FK that \`ratings\` above deliberately refuses, and the contrast
-- is the point: a rating key is any opaque id ladderReport.ts hands us, including a
-- guest/bot \`seat:{roomId}:{seatIdx}\` scaffold that never has an accounts row. An
-- entitlement is only ever minted for a real, logged-in account — a guest has no session,
-- so it has no row here at all (design/19: "byte-identical to today") — so there is no
-- legitimate id that could fail the constraint, and node:sqlite enforcing FKs by default
-- is exactly what we want: a hand-issued row for a typo'd account id fails loudly at the
-- \`sqlite3\` prompt instead of becoming an orphan that silently never delivers.
--
-- Shaped to be read and hand-corrected with plain SQL, since design/19 §7 rules out an
-- admin service: \`WHERE sku LIKE 'character:%'\` covers both namespaces out of one table,
-- and the source CHECK keeps a typo out of the column §7's daily audit groups by.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS entitlements (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id),
  sku TEXT NOT NULL,
  source TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (source IN ('purchase', 'grant', 'event', 'starter', 'drop')),
  -- billsvc's orders.id (design/19 §4). No FK: that table lives in a different database
  -- file on purpose, so the join is reconciliation's job, never SQLite's.
  order_id TEXT,
  granted_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  -- A SKU here is own-or-not, never stacked (design/19 §2) — so this is also the
  -- idempotency key an at-least-once platform callback is delivered through.
  UNIQUE(account_id, sku),
  -- A paid entitlement with no order behind it is unauditable, and §7's reconciliation
  -- could never match it to anything on the platform side.
  CHECK (source <> 'purchase' OR order_id IS NOT NULL)
);

-- Exactly-once ladder settlement (design/19 §3, closing ROADMAP 8.1's one open item). \`POST /rating/report\` is an
-- AT-LEAST-ONCE delivery: ROADMAP 8.1 gave \`reportSettledMatch\` a retry budget, so a report
-- that was DELIVERED and lost only its response (a timeout, a 5xx written after the write)
-- comes back. With nothing to lose a claim to, the retry adds the whole match's rating
-- deltas a second time — 8.1's own note called that "the first thing to do to this seam
-- next", and this table is it.
--
-- The PRIMARY KEY *is* the mechanism, not an index over one. Delivery claims a row with
-- \`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING\` and reads \`changes()\`, inside the SAME transaction
-- that writes \`ratings\` (rating.ts's \`applyMatchOnce\`) — never SELECT-then-INSERT, which
-- answers the question before holding the lock that would make the answer true. That is
-- design/19 §4's first billing rule and its AMENDMENT 2, pointed at this seam.
--
-- No FK and no rating columns: the row is a CLAIM, not a record of what was applied. The
-- deltas are already in \`ratings\`, the report keys are \`ladderReport.ts\`'s
-- \`{roomId}:{digest}\` (see there for why a digest rides along), and \`applied_at\` plus
-- \`WHERE report_key LIKE 'the-room-id:%'\` is what an operator needs to answer "did this
-- room's settlement land?" with plain SQL (design/19 §7 rules out an admin service).
