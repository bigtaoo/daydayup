/**
 * Split of `matchsvc.ts` (P0, 2026-09-04, prep for ROADMAP Phase 8) — the matchmaking
 * route group (ROADMAP 3.3, design/06): the poll-based find API (`POST /find`,
 * `GET /find/:queueId`) and the reconnect reissue (`POST /resume`).
 *
 * Pure wiring around the pure `Matchmaker`: the clock, the seed/roomId source and the
 * bot-fill hook all stay in `matchsvc.ts`'s `createMatchsvcServer`, which hands this group
 * only the built matchmaker, the ticket secret, and `pickGameserver` — the `GameRegistry`
 * lookup (ROADMAP 8.6, design/19 §6) that answers which gameserver this ticket should be
 * redeemed against.
 *
 * The WS URL is stamped onto the RESPONSE here, never into the ticket payload: a ticket is
 * a seat authorization and must not carry topology (design/19 §6, superseding the earlier
 * "put a gameserver id inside the ticket" sketch). `ticket.ts` is untouched by 8.6.
