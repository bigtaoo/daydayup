/**
 * The `/store/*` route group (ROADMAP 8.8's second half, design/19-server-platform.md §4/§9)
 * — matchsvc's proxy in front of the billing plane, and the one place the two authentication
 * namespaces of design/19 §3 meet without touching.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. 8.8 shipped the client half: `client/src/net/billing.ts` calls
 * `GET /store/skus`, `POST /store/order` and `GET /store/order/:id` under the player's own
 * bearer session, against `run.matchBaseUrl` — this process. billsvc answers a DIFFERENT
 * protocol on a different port: `/skus`, `/order/create`, `/order/:id`, behind the internal
 * key, with `accountId` read from the request body. Three mismatches, and none of them is
 * the client's to fix: that file is a landed contract with a defensive parser written around
 * these exact response shapes, so the adaptation belongs here.
 *
 *   client (player bearer)          this proxy                 billsvc (internal key)
 *   ─────────────────────           ──────────                 ──────────────────────
 *   GET  /store/skus        →  verify session, forward   →     GET  /skus
 *   POST /store/order       →  verify session, forward   →     POST /order/create
 *        { sku, platform }        + accountId FROM THE              { accountId, sku, platform }
 *                                   SESSION
 *   GET  /store/order/:id   →  verify session, forward,  →     GET  /order/:id
 *                                then NARROW by accountId
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (§3). An internal route never accepts a player token, and
 * a player route never trusts an accountId the client names. The second half is why
 * `postOrder` below builds its outbound body from three fields rather than forwarding the
 * one it received: an `accountId` in the client's JSON is not overridden, not rejected and
 * not logged — it is never read, so there is no code path along which it could reach
 * `BillingService.createOrder`. Same reasoning as `billsvc/server.ts` not reading `amount`.
 *
 * WHY `getOrder` NARROWS, AND WHY IT ANSWERS 404. billsvc's `GET /order/:id` does not check
 * who owns the order, which is correct for an internal route — its only caller was trusted.
 * Behind a proxy that any logged-in player can reach, that same route turns an order id into
 * a read of somebody else's purchase: their SKU, their price, their platform, their state.
 * So the order is compared against the session's accountId here, and a mismatch answers the
 * SAME 404 a nonexistent id does — telling the two apart would confirm that an id someone
 * guessed belongs to a real account, which is the fact the check exists to withhold.
 *
 * WHY `/store/skus` REQUIRES A SESSION even though billsvc's `/skus` is public. Decided, not
 * defaulted. The catalogue is public information and holding it behind a key buys nothing on
 * the internal port — but this port is the open internet. Three reasons, in order: the client
 * never calls it without a session anyway (`StorePurchase.loadCatalog` refuses with
 * `not-logged-in`, and `net/billing.ts` always sends the header), so requiring one costs no
 * behaviour; one rule across all three routes means nobody has to remember which is the
 * exception; and unauthenticated it is a free unmetered amplifier from anywhere onto the
 * billing plane. The cost is real and named: a store that wants to show prices BEFORE login
 * would have to relax this, and that is a product decision rather than something to leave
 * open by accident.
 *
 * EVERY OUTBOUND CALL GOES THROUGH `internalFetch` (8.1's D2), never a bare `fetch` — an
 * undrained body wedges undici's keep-alive pool, and these are player-facing requests that
 * arrive in bursts. `collectBody`/`internalFetchJson` exist because a proxy, unlike the
 * ladder report and the delivery pump, needs the peer's bytes and not just its status.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE RETRIES. `retry` is opt-in in `internalFetch` and stays absent on all three
 * routes: `POST /order/create` is not idempotent (a retry books a second order), and the two
 * GETs are already retried by a human or by `StorePurchase.poll`, which budgets ~90 s of
 * polling and treats a thrown poll as one lost attempt rather than a failed purchase. A
 * retry ladder inside a request the player is waiting on would only add latency.
