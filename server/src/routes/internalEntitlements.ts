/**
 * The RECEIVING end of the entitlement-delivery loop (design/19 §4, closed 2026-09-05) —
 * the one route that writes `entitlements` with `source = 'purchase'`, and the only caller
 * `EntitlementService.grant` has ever had.
 *
 * It lives in the control plane because `entitlements` does (design/19 §2, `db.ts`), and
 * billsvc's own database is a different FILE — so this HTTP hop is not a topology choice,
 * it is the only way across. billsvc's `deliveryPump.ts` is what calls it, from outside its
 * settlement transaction, over ROADMAP 8.1's internal-key seam.
 *
 * THREE THINGS MAKE THIS SAFE TO CALL AT LEAST ONCE, which is the property the whole outbox
 * design leans on:
 *
 *  1. `entitlements` carries UNIQUE(account_id, sku), and `EntitlementService.grant` is
 *     `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. A redelivery after a lost ack grants nothing a
 *     second time and answers 200, so the pump can mark its row delivered and stop.
 *  2. The FIRST grant's `source`/`order_id` are never overwritten (that class's own rule),
 *     so a redelivery cannot rewrite the audit record of the payment that caused it.
 *  3. Every write here is inside one transaction, so a multi-grant SKU is all-or-nothing
 *     rather than half-applied by a crash — even though (1) would heal that anyway.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES, AND WHY THE STATUS CODE MATTERS. The pump reads any 4xx as terminal (the
 * row goes `failed` and an operator is told money moved with nothing granted) and any 5xx as
 * retryable. So a refusal here has to be one this route would make again given the same
 * bytes: a missing field, an empty grant list, an unknown account. Anything that might
 * succeed on a retry — a locked database, a disk error — answers 5xx instead, and must never
 * be flattened into a 400 that discards a purchase.
 *
 * `source = 'purchase'` and a non-empty `order_id` are not this route's opinion: `db.ts`
 * carries a CHECK for each, and this route is written to satisfy them rather than to work
 * around them — an unauditable paid entitlement is the thing they exist to make impossible.
