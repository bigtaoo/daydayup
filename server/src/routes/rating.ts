/**
 * Split of `matchsvc.ts` (P0, 2026-09-04, prep for ROADMAP Phase 8) — the `/rating/*`
 * route group (design/15, ROADMAP 4.6): the settled-match report the gameserver POSTs once
 * a PvP match resolves with a checkpoint/hash-verified placement result (never the client
 * directly; the gameserver is the one that knows `hashOk`), plus the per-account lookup.
 *
 * ROADMAP 8.1 (2026-09-04) landed here: `POST /rating/report` is now behind
 * `internalAuth.ts`'s timing-safe `x-internal-key`, closing design/19's D1 — the route had
 * no key, no origin check and open CORS while being the one endpoint that can move any
 * account's ladder rating, so anyone could POST an arbitrary placement for an arbitrary
 * `accountId`. `GET /rating/:accountId` is deliberately NOT gated: it is a public read of a
 * player's own visible rank, and it writes nothing.
 *
 * And 8.1's one open item is closed here (design/19 §3): the report carries a `reportKey`,
 * `RatingStore.applyMatchOnce` claims it in the same transaction that moves the ratings, and
 * a LOST claim answers **200 with `duplicate: true`** — see `postReport` for why that is not
 * a 409.

/**
 * The body of a successful report, and the one decision in this file worth arguing.
 *
 * A LOST claim answers **200 with `duplicate: true`**, not 409. The caller is
 * `reportSettledMatch`, an at-least-once sender with a retry budget: a 409 is a non-2xx, so
 * `internalFetch` would count it a failure, log a scary "ladder report failed" line naming a
 * match whose rating actually landed, and — for the retryable statuses — keep asking. A
 * duplicate is not a failure; it is the correct, final answer to "please make sure this was
 * applied". 200 stops the ladder on the first attempt that reaches an already-applied
 * report, which is the proper end of at-least-once delivery meeting an idempotent receiver.
 * The marker is in the body so an operator can still tell the two apart in a log.
 *
 * A report with NO `reportKey` is applied the old, non-deduped way rather than refused. Only
 * one process legitimately calls this route, so a keyless report means version skew across a
 * rolling deploy (an older gameserver against a newer matchsvc), and the two outcomes are:
 * accept it and risk 8.1's bounded double-apply, or 400 it and lose those matches' ratings
 * permanently, since `internalFetch` never retries a 4xx. The first is recoverable and the
 * second is not. It is logged, because "the gameserver has not been redeployed yet" is
 * something an operator can act on and a silent fallback is not. This is not a security
 * hole to keep small: the route is internal-key gated, and anyone who can reach it can
 * already post whatever placements they like.
