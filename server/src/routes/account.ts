/**
 * Split of `matchsvc.ts` (P0, 2026-09-04, prep for ROADMAP Phase 8) — the `/account/*`
 * route group: account-bound meta state (design/16-accounts.md, ROADMAP 2.x's
 * blueprint/loadout persistence). The client's `MetaState`
 * (blueprints/materials/loadout), previously localStorage-only, mirrored here once a
 * player is logged in.
 *
 * Every route here requires a live session; the bearer-token reader lives with the rest of
 * the account trust boundary in `routes/auth.ts` and is imported from there.
 *
 * ROADMAP 8.2 landed here (design/19-server-platform.md §2): `/account/meta` is no longer
 * a blind whole-blob upsert. `meta_state` still stores a whole blob — materials, loadout,
 * in-progress forge state, everything the client legitimately authors — but the two
 * PURCHASABLE fields are owned by the `entitlements` table instead:
 *
 * - `POST` strips ownership out of the blob before storing it. Ignored, not rejected, so
 *   an older client / a guest promoting its local save / an offline replay all keep
 *   working exactly as before (design/19 §2 is explicit about this).
 * - `GET` writes the server's own answer back over those fields, and also returns the raw
 *   entitlement list so the client can tell WHY it owns something (a store UI needs
 *   `source`, and `client/src/net/entitlements.ts` needs it to merge a purchase into a
 *   brand-new account's local state before its first blob exists).
 *
 * A guest never reaches either route — no session, no row, byte-identical to today.
