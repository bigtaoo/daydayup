/**
 * matchsvc (ROADMAP 3.3, design/06) — the matchmaking control plane's HTTP entrypoint.
 * The ONLY control-plane file that touches node:http, exactly as index.ts is the only
 * data-plane file that touches `ws`: it wraps the pure Matchmaker with a real clock, a
 * seed/roomId source, and the shared ticket signer, and exposes the poll-based find API.
 * It also owns the PvP ladder rating store (design/15, ROADMAP 4.6) — matchsvc-side
 * account bookkeeping, entirely separate from `@dd/engine`'s replicated/replay state.
 *
 * A separate process from the WS gameserver (own port, MATCH_PORT default 8788) — the
 * clean control/data split funny uses. The client calls this to get a signed seat ticket,
 * then opens the gameserver socket with it (`/ws?ticket=`). The gameserver calls back
 * into `/rating/report` once a PvP match settles with a checkpoint/hash-verified
 * placement result (design/15's "computed from checkpoint-verified match placements
 * only") — see `MatchRoomDeps.onSettled` (MatchRoom.ts) and its wiring in index.ts.
 *
 * Since the 2026-09-04 P0 split (prep for ROADMAP Phase 8, which adds routes to three of
 * these groups) this file is the ASSEMBLY SHELL only: it builds the services, owns the
 * dispatch chain below, and nothing else. Every handler is a free `(req, res, url, deps)`
 * function under `routes/`, grouped by surface — CLAUDE.md's split form 1 (independent
 * function modules), which is what a linear if/else chain over shared-nothing handlers
 * wants. Per-route documentation lives with each handler; the map is:
 *
 *   POST /find             { playerCount, mode?, partyId? } -> { queueId, match? }    routes/match
 *   GET  /find/:id                                       -> { status: 'queued'|'matched'|'expired', match? }
 *   POST /resume            { token }                     -> { match } | 401 (ROADMAP reconnect)
 *   POST /rating/report     { accountIds, places, teamIds? } -> { changes: [{accountId,before,after}] }
 *   GET  /rating/:accountId                               -> { accountId, rating }    routes/rating
 *   POST /party/create      { playerId }                 -> PartyInfo                 routes/party
 *   POST /party/join        { playerId, code }           -> PartyInfo | 404
 *   POST /party/leave       { partyId, playerId }        -> PartyInfo | null
 *   POST /party/start       { partyId, playerId }        -> PartyInfo | 404 (leader only)
 *   GET  /party/:id                                       -> PartyInfo | 404
 *   POST /auth/register     { username, password }        -> { accountId, username, token } | 400
 *   POST /auth/login        { username, password }        -> { accountId, username, token } | 401
 *   POST /auth/logout       { token }                      -> { ok: true }             routes/auth
 *   GET  /auth/me           (Bearer token)                 -> { accountId, username } | 401
 *   POST /auth/change-password { token, oldPassword, newPassword } -> { ok: true } | 400/401
 *   GET  /account/meta      (Bearer token)  -> { data: MetaState | null, entitlements } | 401
 *   POST /account/meta      (Bearer token) { data }        -> { ok: true } | 400/401    routes/account
 *   GET  /store/skus        (Bearer token)  -> { skus } | 401/502                       routes/store
 *   POST /store/order       (Bearer token) { sku, platform } -> { order, payment } | 400/401/502
 *   GET  /store/order/:id   (Bearer token)  -> { order } | 401/404/502
 *   POST /internal/entitlements/grant  (x-internal-key)  -> { granted, alreadyOwned } | 401/400/404
 *                                                                                     routes/internalEntitlements
 *   GET  /health                                                                       (here)
 *
 * `/store/*` (ROADMAP 8.8, design/19 §4) is the one route group here that answers nothing of
 * its own: it is a PROXY in front of billsvc, and it exists because the two ends of the
 * purchase flow authenticate in different namespaces. A player's bearer session is verified
 * here, in this process, and what leaves for the billing plane is an internal-key call
 * carrying the accountId that session named — never one the client did. See `routes/store.ts`.
 *
 * `/auth/*` and `/account/*` (design/16-accounts.md) are this project's first real
 * account system — `AuthService` owns a SQLite-backed (`node:sqlite`) accounts/sessions
 * store; every `/account/*` route requires a live session via `Authorization: Bearer
 * <token>`, checked by `requireAuth` in `routes/auth.ts`.
 *
 * `match` = { wsUrl, roomId, owner, seed, playerCount, token } — everything the client
 * needs to open `${wsUrl}?ticket=${token}` (see client/src/net/matchmaking.ts). `wsUrl`
 * is chosen per response by `GameRegistry` (ROADMAP 8.6, design/19 §6) and never enters
 * the ticket payload — the ticket is a seat authorization and knows no topology.
