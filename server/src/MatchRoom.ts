/**
 * One co-op match — the server-side room (design/06, ROADMAP 3.1). A thin lifecycle
 * shell around the pure @dd/engine FrameBroadcast core: it fills seats, starts the
 * metronome when the room is full, relays each client's commands into the broadcaster,
 * and fans the resulting batches back out. It is the co-op adaptation of funny's
 * `gameserver/src/Room.ts`, minus the PvP concerns DayDayUp doesn't have (sides/ELO/
 * decks/ticket settlement) and generalised from 2 fixed sides to N co-op seats.
 *
 * Deliberately free of any socket/timer import: the WebSocket glue lives only in the
 * entrypoint (index.ts), which passes in a `Scheduler` (the metronome clock) and
 * `RoomConnection`s (per-seat senders). That keeps the whole lifecycle — seat
 * assignment, match start, batch broadcast, reconnect, settlement — unit-testable with
 * a fake clock and fake connections (see test/MatchRoom.test.ts). The determinism-
 * critical relay logic it wraps is already proven in @dd/engine's own tests.
