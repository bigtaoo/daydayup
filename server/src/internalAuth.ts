/**
 * The INBOUND half of the internal trust seam (design/19 §3, ROADMAP 8.1) — how a route
 * that only another one of our own processes may call proves the caller is one.
 *
 * This is deliberately a THIRD credential namespace, distinct from both of the two that
 * already exist, and the distinction is structural rather than a check:
 *
 *   player session   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` → `AuthService` (design/16-accounts.md)
 *   seat grant       `?ticket=` → `ticket.ts`'s HMAC (ROADMAP 3.3)
 *   internal call    `x-internal-key` → this file
 *
 * Nothing here reads `authorization`, and nothing in `AuthService`/`ticket.ts` reads
 * `x-internal-key`, so an internal route cannot accept a player token even by mistake:
 * there is no code path that would look at one. A player who presents a perfectly valid
 * session token as `x-internal-key` is rejected as `unknown-key`, exactly like a random
 * string. (`routes/http.ts`'s `access-control-allow-headers` also does not list
 * `x-internal-key`, so a cross-origin browser request carrying one fails its own CORS
 * preflight before it is ever sent — the open CORS block on these routes cannot be turned
 * into a way in.)
 *
 * Borrowed from funny's `shared/src/internalAuth`, cut down: its per-caller key registry
 * (one independently-rotatable key per calling service) is the right end state but is not
 * worth the operational surface at three processes. What is kept is the SHAPE — a verifier
 * built from a registry that today holds exactly one entry — so growing a second caller
 * later is a config change rather than a rewrite of every call site.
 *
 * Pure of env, http and globals, the same way `ticket.ts` is: the registry is passed in and
 * the input is a plain header bag, so every branch below is unit-testable with no server.
 * `config.ts` owns where the key comes from; `routes/rating.ts` owns what a rejection does.
