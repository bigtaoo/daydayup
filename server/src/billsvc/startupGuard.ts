/**
 * FAIL CLOSED, SECOND OF TWO DEFENCES (design/19-server-platform.md §5): the billing
 * process refuses to START when a dev-only flag is set in a production environment.
 *
 * The first defence is `iap/factory.ts`, which makes the dev stub unreachable under
 * `NODE_ENV=production` regardless of the flag. design/19's argument for having both:
 * "One of those checks is the design; two is the design surviving a deploy." A single
 * check is one refactor away from being the wrong one.
 *
 * WHY THESE TWO FILES SHARE NO CODE. The obvious tidy-up is for this file to import
 * `devStubEnabled` from the factory. That would make both defences one defence with two
 * call sites: a bug in that predicate takes out both at once, which is exactly the failure
 * mode "twice over" is meant to survive. The three-line predicate below is duplicated on
 * purpose. Its test asserts the DUPLICATE, not the shared helper.
 *
 * Refusing to start is the right severity rather than a warning: the flag being set in
 * production means the deploy is misconfigured, and a billing process that runs anyway is
 * one where the operator's next signal is a granted entitlement nobody paid for.
