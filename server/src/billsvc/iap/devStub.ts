/**
 * What the dev "platform" believes it charged.
 *
 * THE HONEST SCOPE PROBLEM, STATED. Reconciliation compares the local `orders` table against
 * the platform's own order list, and this project has no merchant account on any of the four
 * real platforms (design/19 §9) — so there is no platform list to pull, and there will not be
 * one until a product decision is made. design/19 §5 already answered the same problem for
 * verification: the dev stub is what makes an unverifiable chain testable end to end, and it
 * is a long-lived asset rather than scaffolding. This is that answer applied to the
 * reconciliation port.
 *
 * IT IS AUTHORED, NOT DERIVED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. Nothing in this class reads
 * billsvc's tables. A dev platform whose order list were computed from local `orders` could
 * only ever report zero differences — it would be a reconciliation that passes by
 * construction, which is worse than no reconciliation because it looks like evidence. A
 * harness (or a test) puts orders in here, and the three difference classes are then all
 * producible: an order the platform never saw, a payment that never reached this server, and
 * a row whose amount or SKU disagrees.
 *
 * ONE BOOK PER `createBillingAdapters` CALL, never a module-level singleton: two tests, or a
 * process and a test in the same worker, must not be able to see each other's platform.
