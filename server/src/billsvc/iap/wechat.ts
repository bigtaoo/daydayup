/**
 * WeChat Pay order verification — SHAPE ONLY (design/19-server-platform.md §5/§9).
 * Same posture as `apple.ts`: two outcomes, both failures, nothing ever granted.
 *
 * What the real implementation is: WeChat has no "receipt" in the App Store sense — the
 * callback carries a merchant order number (`out_trade_no`) and a WeChat transaction id
 * (`transaction_id`), and verification is a v3 `GET /pay/transactions/id/{transaction_id}`
 * signed with the merchant private key, accepting only `trade_state === 'SUCCESS'`. The
 * SKU is therefore recovered from the merchant's own order, i.e. from `orders` in this
 * package, not from anything WeChat returns.
 *
 * `design/19-server-platform.md` §9 records that which platform ships first is a product
 * decision; nothing in this file assumes it is this one.

 * What the real implementation is: WeChat Pay has no "list transactions" endpoint at all.
 * The supported answer is the daily bill — `GET /v3/bill/tradebill?bill_date=YYYY-MM-DD&
 * bill_type=SUCCESS`, which returns a signed download URL for a gzipped CSV that is then
 * fetched and parsed. So the `[since, until)` window this signature takes has to be mapped
 * onto whole Beijing-time bill days, and a window narrower than a day cannot be answered
 * exactly. Recorded here because it is the constraint that will shape the daily job's
 * schedule, not an implementation detail.
