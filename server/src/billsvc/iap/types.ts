 * locks bounded direct purchase with no gacha and NO wallet, so that secondary branch is
 * the only branch here and the coin fields do not exist at all. There is deliberately no
 * `coins`, no balance and no wallet anywhere in this type — a field like that is how an
 * economy gets imported by accident (design/19 §8).
