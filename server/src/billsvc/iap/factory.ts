/**
 * The credential-reading dispatch (design/19-server-platform.md §5): one factory that
 * closes over an environment and returns a `ReceiptVerifier`. Borrowed shape — funny's
 * `commercial/src/iap/` is a per-platform set of independent functions behind one
 * factory, which is CLAUDE.md's preferred split form and survived four platforms there.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, FIRST OF TWO DEFENCES. This file enforces:
 *
 *   1. Under `NODE_ENV=production` the dev stub is off, FULL STOP — `DDU_BILLING_DEV_STUB`
 *      is not consulted at all, so a mis-set env var on a production box cannot switch it
 *      back on.
 *   2. Missing credentials mean VERIFICATION FAILS. There is no fallback to the stub, in
 *      any environment. A platform with nothing configured returns a failure (never a
 *      throw, so one unconfigured platform cannot 500 the webhook route for the others),
 *      and a failure grants nothing.
 *
 * The second defence is `../startupGuard.ts`, which refuses to START the process with the
 * dev flag set in production. design/19: "One of those checks is the design; two is the
 * design surviving a deploy." The two deliberately share no code — see that file's note.

 * The reconciliation port's dispatch (design/19 §7, ROADMAP 8.5) — the same shape as

 *   1. Under `NODE_ENV=production` the dev platform is off, full stop, because
 *      `devStubEnabled` says so before `DDU_BILLING_DEV_STUB` is read.
 *   2. A platform with no credentials REFUSES rather than returning an empty list. That is
 *      the rule with teeth here: an empty list is not a neutral answer to "what did you
 *      charge" — it would make every local order look like one the platform never saw, or,
 *      read the other way, print a clean reconciliation for a check that never ran.
 *      `reconcile.ts` keeps those refusals as a first-class `unreconciled` field for exactly
 *      that reason.
 *
 * `book` is the dev platform's own order list. Passing `undefined` is not the same as passing
 * an empty book: no book means the dev platform REFUSES too, because "nobody configured a
 * platform to compare against" and "the platform charged nothing" are different facts and
 * only one of them is evidence.
