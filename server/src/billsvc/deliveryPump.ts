/**
 * Split of the delivery seam (2026-09-05): the ASYNC half of the closed entitlement loop —
 * it drains `outbox.ts`'s `deliveries` table into the control plane's `entitlements` table
 * over ROADMAP 8.1's internal seam. `outbox.ts` owns the durable half.
 *
 * This is the only place in the billing plane that makes an outbound network call, and it
 * sits strictly OUTSIDE the settlement transaction. That placement is the whole design:
 * an HTTP call from inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` would hold SQLite's write lock across a round
 * trip (serialising every settlement behind the slowest control-plane response) and would
 * still not be atomic with the remote write, so it would buy the cost of the tear without
 * removing it.
 *
 * Pure of env and globals, the same way `internalAuth.ts` and `ticket.ts` are: the URL, the
 * key, the clock, `fetch` and `sleep` all arrive through `deps`, so every branch below runs
 * with no server, no network and no timers. `server.ts` is where `config.ts` is read.
 *
 * WHEN IT RUNS, and why it is not just an interval. Three triggers, in the order they
 * matter:
 *
 *   1. OPPORTUNISTICALLY, right after a settlement commits (`server.ts`'s webhook). This is
 *      the one that delivers a purchase in the sub-second a player is still looking at the
 *      payment sheet; the other two exist for when it fails.
 *   2. ONCE AT STARTUP (`main.ts`). This is the only reason the table exists — a process
 *      that died between the COMMIT and the delivery must resume, and nothing else will
 *      re-trigger those rows.
 *   3. A BOUNDED INTERVAL as the backstop, for a control plane that was down when 1 and 2
 *      ran and came back later.
 *
 * An interval alone would be simpler and is the wrong shape for this repo: it makes every
 * purchase wait a tick for no reason, and it makes the delivery latency a function of a
 * tuning constant instead of of the settlement. A queue process is the other direction and
 * is the thing design/19 §8 declines to build — "no infrastructure the team does not need
 * yet". Opportunistic-plus-backstop is what that principle looks like when the work is
 * genuinely asynchronous.
 *
 * FAILURE POLICY, which is where the branches are:
 *
 *   4xx  the control plane refused on purpose — an unknown account, a malformed body, a
 *        rejected key. Repeating it verbatim cannot change the answer, so the row goes
 *        TERMINAL (`failed`) and is logged as an error. Money taken, nothing granted: this
 *        is a human's problem now, and saying so loudly beats retrying forever in silence.
 *   5xx, the peer is broken, unreachable or restarting. The row stays `pending` and is
 *   net, retried on the next sweep, forever. Giving up would lose a purchase; a peer that
 *   timeout comes back heals every stuck row at once. `attempts` is what an operator
 *        alerts on.
 *
 * `internalFetch`'s own bounded retry runs INSIDE one sweep (three attempts, backing off),
 * so a one-second blip never reaches the table at all; the sweep-level retry above is for
 * outages longer than that.
