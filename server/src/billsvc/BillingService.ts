/**
 * Orders, receipts and delivery (design/19-server-platform.md §4). A pure class over an
 * injected `DatabaseSync` — the same dependency-injection shape as `AuthService` /
 * `PartyService` / `Matchmaker`, so every test runs against a `:memory:` billing DB with
 * no disk I/O and no HTTP.
 *
 * The five rules from design/19 §4, and where each one lives:
 *
 *  1. IDEMPOTENCY IS A CLAIM, NEVER A LOOK-BEFORE-WRITE. Platform callbacks are
 *     at-least-once by contract. Delivery is `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` followed
 *     by reading `changes()` — win the claim or deliver nothing. There is no
 *     SELECT-then-INSERT anywhere on the settlement path. `settle` claims TWICE: the
 *     receipt row's primary key and the ledger row's `purchase:<platform>:<txn>` id. The
 *     second claim alone is what design/19 names; the first is what stops a forged
 *     callback from varying `txnId` to re-deliver one receipt (see `settle`).
 *  2. DELIVERY IS TRIGGERED BY THE CALLBACK, NEVER BY THE CLIENT. `createOrder` books an
 *     order and returns payment parameters; `getOrder` polls. Neither can grant anything —
 *     `deliver.grant` is reachable from `settle` and from nowhere else.
 *  3. PRICE COMES FROM THE SERVER. `createOrder` takes no amount. Not "ignores one" —
 *     there is no parameter, so a caller-supplied price cannot be plumbed in by mistake;
 *     the route layer drops it from the body.
 *  4. A RECEIPT BELONGING TO ANOTHER ACCOUNT IS REJECTED, NOT REPLAYED. funny's comment is
 *     the whole argument: replaying it mirrors another account's state back to the caller.
 *     Decided from INSIDE the transaction, when the receipt claim is lost — see `settle`.
 *  5. A RECEIPT RECORDS THE PRODUCT IT RESOLVED TO. Without it a receipt bought for one
 *     SKU can be replayed to claim another, so the verified product is compared with the
 *     order's SKU before anything is written, and stored on the row afterwards.
 *
 * And the sixth, from `delivery.ts`: the order update, the ledger row and the entitlement
 * grant are one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. funny's verify-and-heal CAS saga is deliberately not
 * copied — see that file. This class knows nothing about how the grant is honoured: the
 * shipped implementation (`outbox.ts`) writes a durable delivery obligation into a fourth
 * table in this same file and a pump drains it afterwards, and swapping that for something
 * else must not require reading a line of this file.
 *
 * Verification happens BEFORE the transaction opens. A real adapter is an HTTPS round
 * trip, and holding SQLite's write lock across one would serialise every settlement in
 * the process behind the slowest platform response.
