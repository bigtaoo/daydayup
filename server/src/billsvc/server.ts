/**
 * billsvc's HTTP surface (design/19-server-platform.md §4/§5) — the billing plane, a
 * third process on `BILL_PORT` (default 8789), deliberately not folded into the control
 * plane: matchsvc restarts on a matchmaking cadence, and platform callbacks need a stable
 * entry point, pinned credentials and an audit boundary.
 *
 * The ONLY file in this package that touches `node:http`, exactly as `matchsvc.ts` is for
 * the control plane and `index.ts` for the data plane. `createBillsvcServer` builds the
 * server WITHOUT starting it — the seam that makes real requests testable on an ephemeral
 * port — and `main.ts` is the CLI entry point.
 *
 *   GET  /health                                            → { ok, service }
 *   GET  /skus                                              → { skus }                       (public)
 *   POST /order/create   { accountId, sku, platform }        → { order, payment } | 400 | 401 (internal)
 *   GET  /order/:id                                         → { order } | 404 | 401          (internal)
 *   POST /webhook/:platform { orderId, receipt, txnId, event? }
 *                                                           → { delivered } | 400 | 404      (platform-signed)
 *
 * WHO MAY CALL WHAT. Every route except the webhook is behind the internal-key guard: a
 * player's client never talks to this port, it asks the control plane, which forwards with
 * its internal key. `/skus` is the exception in the other direction — a price list is
 * public by definition and holding it behind a key buys nothing.
 *
 * The webhook is NOT internal-key authenticated, by design (§3: "authenticated by the
 * platform's own signature instead"). No platform credential exists in this project (§9),
 * so today the only thing standing between that route and the database is receipt
 * verification — which is precisely why `iap/factory.ts` fails closed on missing
 * credentials, and why a `product:` receipt is inert unless the dev stub is enabled.
 *
 * `POST /order/create` DROPS `amount`. Reading the field and ignoring it would be the same
 * behaviour; not reading it is the version that survives someone adding a "pass-through"
 * later (design/19 §4: "An `amount` in the request body is discarded").
 *
 * DELIVERY (design/19 §4's closed loop, 2026-09-05). This is where the two halves are wired:
 * `outbox.ts`'s delivery is what `BillingService` calls inside the settlement transaction,
 * and `deliveryPump.ts` is what drains the row it wrote into the control plane's
 * `entitlements` table afterwards. The webhook triggers a sweep opportunistically after a
 * settlement commits, WITHOUT awaiting it — the platform's callback must answer fast and
 * must not be coupled to a peer that may be down, and the settlement is already durable by
 * then. `main.ts` arms the startup sweep and the backstop interval.
 *
 * EVERY WEBHOOK EVENT IS LOGGED (design/19 §7, ROADMAP 8.5, `webhookLog.ts`). Every branch of
 * the webhook route below writes one `webhook_events` row before it answers — the settlement,
 * the replay, the cancel, the refusal, the unrecognised event type, and the body that was not
 * even JSON. Before that, only a callback that settled left any trace at all, and "why did my
 * payment not go through" had no evidence behind it. The recording is deliberately in the
 * ROUTE rather than in `BillingService`: several of those branches never reach `settle`, and a
 * log that covered only the ones that did would miss exactly the cases it exists for.
 *
 * AN UNKNOWN EVENT TYPE IS RECORDED AND NOT ACTED ON. It used to fall through into `settle`,
 * which meant a platform sending `refunded` or `chargeback` would have had it treated as a
 * purchase callback. Now `webhookEventType` narrows to a known set and anything else answers
 * 200 with `ignored: true` — 200 rather than 4xx because a platform retrying an event this
 * server has simply not implemented is noise, and the row is where anyone finds out it
 * started arriving.
