/**
 * Daily reconciliation (design/19-server-platform.md §7, ROADMAP 8.5) — a sibling module of
 * free functions, CLAUDE.md's first split form, deliberately not a `BillingService` method:
 * this reads the same tables but answers a different question, and it must be drivable from
 * a cron script with no HTTP server in the process.
 *
 * WHAT TEAR THIS COVERS. design/19 §4 argues that funny's verify-and-heal CAS saga is
 * unnecessary here because `orders`, `receipts` and `ledger` are three tables in one SQLite
 * file and one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` makes a tear between them impossible; §4's closing paragraph
 * then names the tear that is still real — between the PLATFORM and the local transaction —
 * and hands it to this file. A payment that succeeded on the platform's side and whose
 * callback never arrived (or arrived and was refused) leaves NO local row at all, so nothing
 * inside this database can notice it. Only a comparison against the platform's own list can.
 *
 * THE HONEST SCOPE PROBLEM, AND WHAT IS DONE ABOUT IT — read this before trusting a green
 * report. This project has no merchant account on any of the four real platforms
 * (design/19 §9), so there is no platform order list to pull, and there will not be one until
 * a product decision is made. That is handled the same way ROADMAP 8.4 handled the same
 * problem for verification: "list the platform's recent orders" is an injected PORT
 * (`PlatformOrderLister`), the dev stub implements it against its own authored order book,
 * and the four real adapters each carry the call they would make and return
 * not-implemented.
 *
 * The consequence is stated in the report's own shape rather than in a comment. A platform
 * whose port refuses does NOT contribute zero differences — it lands in `unreconciled`, and
 * `ReconcileReport.complete` is false whenever that list is non-empty. There is no code path
 * that can report a clean reconciliation for a check that did not run.
 *
 * THE DIFFERENCE CLASSES, all three of them, joined on `platform_txn_id`:
 *
 *   'local-not-on-platform'  a settled local order the platform does not list. Either the
 *                            window is wrong, or something claimed a transaction that never
 *                            happened — the shape a forged callback would leave, which is
 *                            why this class is reported even though it is the rarest.
 *   'platform-not-local'     the platform charged and this server has nothing. THE tear §4
 *                            leaves open: the player paid and owns nothing. Loudest class.
 *   'amount-mismatch'        same transaction, different money.
 *   'sku-mismatch'           same transaction, different product. A receipt redeemed against
 *                            the wrong SKU is exactly what design/19 §4's rule 5 exists to
 *                            stop at settlement time; this is the same question asked later,
 *                            from the other side, where rule 5 cannot see it.
 *
 * (Four kinds, three classes: amount and SKU are both "present on both sides and disagreeing"
 * and are counted together as the third class, but reported separately because they mean
 * different things to whoever reads them.)
 *
 * NOTHING HERE ACTS. No order is changed, no entitlement is granted or revoked, no delivery
 * is retried. A difference is a finding, and design/19 §7's principle for the audit next door
 * applies here too: with no evidence, skip — never convict. Reconciliation's job is to make
 * the tear visible to a human, not to guess which side is right.
