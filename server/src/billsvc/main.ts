/**
 * billsvc's process entry point (design/19-server-platform.md §4). Third process, own
 * port, own SQLite file. Kept separate from `server.ts` for the same reason `matchsvc.ts`
 * keeps `main()` beside `createMatchsvcServer` but only calls it when run directly: the
 * builder has to be importable by a test without binding a port.
 *
 * The first thing `main` does is `assertBillingStartupSafety`, which THROWS rather than
 * warns (`startupGuard.ts`). That is deliberate and it is the second of design/19 §5's two
 * fail-closed defences: a billing process whose dev receipt stub is reachable in
 * production must not come up at all.
 *
 * The last thing it does is `pump.start()`, and that ordering is the whole reason the
 * delivery outbox exists. A process that died between a settlement's COMMIT and its
 * entitlement grant left `deliveries` rows behind that nothing will ever re-trigger — no
 * webhook is coming a second time, and the platform considers the payment done. The startup
 * sweep is what picks them up (`deliveryPump.ts`, trigger 2), and it runs here rather than
 * in `createBillsvcServer` because a builder that arms a background interval cannot be
 * called by a test without leaving one running.
