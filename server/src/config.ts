 * verifies) so they agree on the secret.
 *
 * Posture: a real `DDU_TICKET_SECRET` → production signing. Unset → a shared, well-known
 * DEV secret so the online path works out of the box locally, with a loud warning; in that
 * dev mode the gameserver also still honours the legacy raw-param handshake for manual

 * rejects every internal call — design/19 §5's "fail closed in production" principle, which
 * that section states for the billing dev stub and which applies here for the same reason.
 * The alternative is a deploy that misses one env var and silently ships a route whose key
 * is published in this file, which is indistinguishable from having no key at all.
 *
 * Read per CALL, never captured at module scope, for the reason `config.test.ts` spells out
 * for `ticketSecret`: a module-scope capture makes the answer depend on whether the
