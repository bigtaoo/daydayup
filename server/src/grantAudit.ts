/**
 * The daily non-`purchase` entitlement audit (design/19-server-platform.md §7, ROADMAP 8.5).
 * A module of free functions, CLAUDE.md's first split form.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A STANDALONE MODULE AND NOT A ROUTE. design/19 §7 ends with "No admin service.
 * funny has a whole one. Here the requirement is weaker but real: the schema must be
 * queryable and hand-correctable by a human with SQL." So there is no admin surface to hang
 * this off, and adding one to the control plane to hold a cron job would be building exactly
 * the thing that section declines. This module plus `server/scripts/grantAudit.ts` is the
 * whole thing: the script opens the account database READ-ONLY, the module decides, and the
 * findings go to `billsvc`'s review queue.
 *
 * WHAT IT COUNTS. `entitlements.source` (design/19 §2, `db.ts`) is one of `purchase`, `grant`,
 * `event`, `starter`, `drop`. Everything except `purchase` is a thing an account received
 * without money moving, and a burst of them in one day is the shape of a support tool being
 * abused, a campaign misconfigured, or a bug granting in a loop. `purchase` is excluded
 * because the money IS the evidence, and it already has an audit trail on the billing side.
 *
 * ═══ WITH NO EVIDENCE, SKIP — NEVER CONVICT ═══
 *
 * design/19 §7 states this principle for exactly this audit and points at where it already
 * holds: `design/15-pvp-arena.md`'s checkpoint quorum. That mechanism runs no consensus check
 * at all below a quorum of real seats (an early low-population match is EXPECTED to be
 * internally inconsistent, and a majority of three means nothing), and severs a seat only on
 * a CONSECUTIVE run of mismatches — never on one stray report, which is more likely a benign
 * catch-up race. Both halves carry over literally:
 *
 *   - No inference from absence. A row whose `source` is not one this audit counts is SKIPPED,
 *     not counted. An account with no rows produces no finding. There is no "suspiciously
 *     few", no "unusual pattern", nothing derived from what is missing.
 *   - Exactly at the threshold is NOT an anomaly. The comparison is `count > threshold`, and
 *     that is a decision rather than an off-by-one: the threshold is the largest count anyone
 *     has said is fine, so a count equal to it is a case somebody already accepted.
 *   - It FILES, it does not act. The output is `review_queue` rows. Nothing here revokes,
 *     suspends, or flags an account to any other system. `EntitlementService.revoke` exists so
 *     that a HUMAN's correction is a supported operation, and is called by nothing in this
 *     server — deliberately, and this module is the closest thing to a caller it will have.

 * `db.ts`'s CHECK constraint does not silently change what this audit convicts on — a new
 * source arrives uncounted, and whoever adds it decides.
 *
 * A note for the day a starter pack ships: `starter` is a new-account gift, so an account
 * created with more than `threshold` of them would trip this every time. That is not a reason
 * to weaken the threshold — it is a reason to pass `countedSources` without `'starter'` at
 * that point. Nothing grants `starter` today.
