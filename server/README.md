# Server — co-op frame-broadcast gameserver

The **net layer** for online co-op (design/06, ROADMAP 3.1). A server-driven
frame-broadcast lockstep data plane (the 王者荣耀 / funny `gameserver` pattern): the
server owns the clock and broadcasts one frame packet per pulse, **never waiting for a
client** — a lagging player falls behind the broadcast and catches up alone.

It is deliberately thin. The determinism-critical relay logic lives in **`@dd/engine`**
(`net/FrameBroadcast.ts`) and is consumed identically by client and server — the design/06
anti-drift rule ("one definition, same bytes on both sides"). This package only adds the
**I/O orchestration** around it: seat assignment, the metronome, sockets.

## Layout

This package hosts **both planes** (design/06), each with its own entrypoint but a shared
pure core + the shared ticket module:

**Data plane** — the WebSocket frame relay (ROADMAP 3.1):

| File | Role | `ws`? | Tested |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| `src/MatchRoom.ts`   | One match's lifecycle: fill seats → start → relay → settle. Wraps `FrameBroadcast`. | no | ✅ `test/MatchRoom.test.ts` |
| `src/RoomManager.ts` | `roomId → MatchRoom`; routes `ClientMsg`; first joiner defines the match. | no | ✅ |
| `src/index.ts`       | WebSocket bootstrap — the ONLY file that imports `ws`; wraps sockets as `RoomConnection`s, provides the real-timer `Scheduler`, and **verifies the `/ws?ticket=` handshake**. | yes | typecheck only |

**Control plane** — matchmaking + tickets (ROADMAP 3.3):

| File | Role | I/O? | Tested |
|------|------|------|--------|
| `src/ticket.ts`      | Stateless HMAC-SHA256 sign/verify over `{roomId,owner,seed,playerCount,exp}`. Shared by both planes. | no | ✅ `test/ticket.test.ts` |
| `src/Matchmaker.ts`  | Pure queue: `enqueue`→group-when-full→signed tickets, `poll`. Injected clock/seed/roomId/signer. | no | ✅ `test/Matchmaker.test.ts` |
| `src/matchsvc.ts`    | HTTP bootstrap and assembly shell — the ONLY control-plane file that imports `node:http`; wires the real clock/seed/signer around `Matchmaker`, then dispatches to `src/routes/`. | yes | ✅ `test/matchsvc.http.test.ts` |
| `src/routes/*.ts`    | One module per surface (`auth`, `account`, `match`, `party`, `rating`, `store`, `internalEntitlements`), each a set of free `(req, res, url, deps)` handlers, over a shared `routes/http.ts` (CORS, `send`, `readJson`). | no | ✅ `test/routes.test.ts` + the two `*.http.test.ts` |
| `src/db.ts` / `src/AuthService.ts` | The SQLite (`node:sqlite`) account store: `accounts`/`sessions`/`ratings`/`meta_state`/`entitlements`/`rating_reports` (design/16-accounts.md). | file | ✅ `test/db.test.ts`, `test/AuthService.test.ts` |
| `src/rating.ts` / `src/ladderReport.ts` | The ladder: Elo-ish squad-aware deltas, the store, and the pure placement→rank conversion. `applyMatchOnce` claims `rating_reports.report_key` (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` + `changes()`) inside the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` that writes `ratings`, which is what makes the at-least-once settlement report exactly-once (design/19 §3). | no | ✅ `test/rating.test.ts`, `test/ladderReport.test.ts`, `test/ratingReportOnce.test.ts` |
| `src/EntitlementService.ts` | Server-owned blueprint/character ownership (design/19 §2, ROADMAP 8.2) — the reason `/account/meta` is no longer a blind whole-blob upsert. Grant is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` + `changes`, so an at-least-once delivery is idempotent. | no | ✅ `test/EntitlementService.test.ts` |
| `src/routes/internalEntitlements.ts` | `POST /internal/entitlements/grant` (8.7) — the ONLY caller of `EntitlementService.grant`, behind `internalAuth`. billsvc's delivery pump is what calls it. A 4xx here is read as terminal by that pump, so every refusal has to be one the same bytes would earn again. | no | ✅ `test/routes.internalEntitlements.test.ts` |
| `src/config.ts`      | The one place that reads `DDU_TICKET_SECRET`, `DDU_INTERNAL_KEY`, `DDU_MATCHSVC_URL` and `DDU_BILLSVC_URL` (env), so all three planes agree on each. | env | ✅ `test/config.test.ts` + `test/config.internalKeys.test.ts` |
| `src/internalAuth.ts` | Inbound service-to-service auth (ROADMAP 8.1): `x-internal-key` against a per-caller registry, hashed before `timingSafeEqual`. A THIRD credential namespace — never a player token. | no | ✅ `test/internalAuth.test.ts`, `test/internalTrustSeam.test.ts` |
| `src/internalFetch.ts` | Outbound service-to-service calls: always drains the response body, explicit per-attempt timeout, opt-in bounded retry. `collectBody`/`internalFetchJson` READ the body instead of cancelling it — the same drain obligation, for the one caller that needs the bytes. | no | ✅ `test/internalFetch.test.ts` |
| `src/routes/store.ts` | `/store/skus`, `/store/order`, `/store/order/:id` (8.8) — matchsvc's proxy in front of billsvc, and the one file where the two credential namespaces meet. Verifies the player's bearer session locally, then forwards over `internalFetch` with the accountId **that session** named. `GET /store/order/:id` is narrowed to the caller's own account (billsvc does not check ownership) and billsvc's 401 becomes a 502, never a relayed 401. | net | ✅ `test/routes.store.test.ts`, `test/store.proxy.http.test.ts` |

**Billing plane** — orders, receipts, IAP, entitlement delivery, operations (ROADMAP 8.3/8.4/8.5/8.7, design/19 §4/§5/§7):

| File | Role | I/O? | Tested |
|------|------|------|--------|
| `src/billingDb.ts` | billsvc's OWN SQLite file (`DDU_BILLING_DB_PATH`): `orders`/`receipts`/append-only `ledger`/`deliveries`, plus 8.5's `webhook_events`/`review_queue`. Six tables, and a test asserts exactly those and no more. Deliberately NOT `db.ts`'s `openDb` — money gets its own file, and a shared opener is how that gets undone. | file | ✅ `test/billingDb.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/BillingService.ts` | The five §4 rules. `settle` claims the receipt row AND the ledger row (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` + `changes()`), then updates the order and grants — one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so a refused grant rolls all of it back. | no | ✅ `test/billsvc.BillingService.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/delivery.ts` | The entitlement seam, called from INSIDE that transaction — synchronous and `void`, so a throw rolls the settlement back. `ledgerOnlyDelivery` is the explicit opt-out, no longer the default. | no | ✅ (above) |
| `src/billsvc/outbox.ts` | The DURABLE half of the closed loop (8.7): one synchronous INSERT into `deliveries`, in the settlement transaction, keyed on the LEDGER row's id. After the COMMIT the delivery is OWED on disk. | no | ✅ `test/billsvc.outbox.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/deliveryPump.ts` | The ASYNC half: drains `deliveries` into matchsvc's `POST /internal/entitlements/grant` over `internalFetch`. Opportunistic after a settlement + a startup sweep + a bounded backstop. 4xx is terminal and loud; 5xx/network stays owed forever. Since 8.5 a terminal row is also FILED into `review_queue`, in the same transaction that makes it terminal. | net | ✅ `test/billsvc.deliveryPump.test.ts`, `test/billsvc.deliveryLoop.test.ts`, `test/billsvc.moneyTaken.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/skus.ts` | The server-side price table. `createOrder` has no `amount` parameter, so a body price cannot be plumbed in. | no | ✅ `test/billsvc.skus.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/iap/*.ts` | One module per platform behind `createReceiptVerifier` AND `createPlatformOrderLister` (8.5's reconciliation port), plus the `product:<sku>` dev stub and its authored `DevStubOrderBook`. Missing credentials FAIL on both — never fall back to the stub, and never answer an order listing with an empty list. | net | ✅ `test/billsvc.iap.test.ts`, `test/billsvc.reconcile.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/startupGuard.ts` | Second fail-closed check: refuses to START with a dev flag under `NODE_ENV=production`. Shares no code with the first, on purpose. | no | ✅ `test/billsvc.startupGuard.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/server.ts` | HTTP surface — the ONLY billing file that imports `node:http`. Every route behind `internalAuth` except `/health`, `/skus` and the platform webhook. | yes | ✅ `test/billsvc.http.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/main.ts` | Process entry on `BILL_PORT` (8789). Asserts startup safety BEFORE binding a port or creating a file. | yes | ✅ `test/billsvc.main.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/webhookLog.ts` | 8.5: EVERY platform callback, not just the one that settled — keyed `${txnId}:${eventType}` and upserted, with an order-id and then a raw-bytes-hash fallback so an unparsable payload still gets its own row. `raw` keeps the FIRST body; `divergences` counts redeliveries that changed it. | no | ✅ `test/billsvc.webhookLog.test.ts`, `test/billsvc.webhookEvents.http.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/reconcile.ts` | 8.5: the local↔platform comparison design/19 §4 leaves open, over an injected `PlatformOrderLister`. A platform that could not be asked lands in `unreconciled` and `complete` goes false — there is no path that reports clean for a check that did not run. Driven by `scripts/reconcile.ts`. | no | ✅ `test/billsvc.reconcile.test.ts` |
| `src/billsvc/reviewQueue.ts` | 8.5: the one place a human is told to look. Two producers (the grant audit, and the pump's money-taken-nothing-granted rows), `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on a producer-minted key, and nothing in this server ever acts on an entry. | no | ✅ `test/billsvc.reviewQueue.test.ts` |
| `src/grantAudit.ts` | 8.5: counts non-`purchase` `entitlements` grants per account per UTC day and FILES anything over the threshold. `design/15`'s checkpoint-quorum principle — exactly AT the threshold is not an anomaly, an uncounted source is skipped, nothing is ever revoked. Control-plane table, so it is a module + `scripts/grantAudit.ts`, not a matchsvc route. | no | ✅ `test/grantAudit.test.ts` |

A player's client talks to the **control plane only**. It never reaches the billing plane's port:
the store routes above are the proxy in front of it, and billsvc's own routes are internal-key or
platform-signed (design/19 §3).

`MatchRoom`/`RoomManager` take an injected `Scheduler` (the metronome clock) and
`RoomConnection`s (per-seat senders), so the whole lifecycle is unit-tested with a fake
clock and fake sockets — no network, no timers. The relay *content* (command ordering,
the monotonic watermark, the reconnect log) is proven in `@dd/engine`'s
`framebroadcast.test.ts`, including a **loopback test** that runs
`FrameBroadcast → NetInputSource → engine` and asserts it reproduces a plain replay
byte-for-byte.

## Protocol

Shared wire types live in `@dd/engine/net/protocol.ts` (`ClientMsg` / `ServerMsg`).
Messages are newline-free JSON — `PlayerCommand` is already compact plain data (integer
brad/mag/buttons), so JSON is fine for the co-op MVP; a WeChat/production build would swap
a binary codec in behind the same seam. The server **never interprets** a command's
meaning; it only buckets commands by frame and broadcasts them, stamping each with the
sender's authoritative seat (`owner`) so a client can only ever move its own player.

- `match_start` — sent when the room fills; carries `seed`, `playerCount`, and this
  client's `localOwner`. The client builds `EngineConfig.players` of length `playerCount`.
- `frame_batch` — one broadcast pulse: the confirmed `toFrame` watermark + any non-empty
  frames since the last pulse. `NetInputSource` folds it into the engine's confirmed stream.
- `conn_resync` — reconnect catch-up: the frame log past the client's `lastFrame`.
- `match_over` — the settled outcome (also re-judged client-side via `runHeadless`).

Tick rates: **sim 30 Hz**, **net 10 Hz** (one batch / 100 ms covering 3 sim frames) —
the funny defaults; both `FrameBroadcast` and `NetInputSource` take these as options so
the pairing stays in lock-step. (design/06 leaves 30 vs 20 Hz open, to decide after WeChat
CPU measurement.)

## Run

One package of a root npm workspace — `npm install` once at the repo root covers it.

```bash
npm run dev:server    # data plane: ws://0.0.0.0:8787/ws  (PORT/HOST env override)
npm run dev:matchsvc  # control plane: http://0.0.0.0:8788  (MATCH_PORT env override)
npm run billsvc -w server   # billing plane: http://0.0.0.0:8789  (BILL_PORT env override)
```

Two operational jobs, both CLI-only and neither scheduled by anything yet (ROADMAP 8.5):

```bash
npm run reconcile -w server -- --days=1        # local orders vs the platform's list; --strict to exit 1
npm run audit:grants -w server -- --dry-run    # non-purchase grants per account per UTC day
```

`reconcile` reports **INCOMPLETE** for the four real platforms, because none of them has a
credential in this project — that is the honest answer, not a failure of the run. `audit:grants`
opens the account database **read-only** and files into billsvc's `review_queue`; re-running it
over a day it has already filed produces nothing.

Or from inside `server/`: `npm test` (ticket / Matchmaker / MatchRoom / RoomManager),
`npm run typecheck` (incl. all three entrypoints), `npm run dev`, `npm run matchsvc`, `npm run billsvc`.

**Handshake (ROADMAP 3.3):** the client calls the control plane to matchmake —
`POST /find {playerCount}` then poll `GET /find/:queueId` — and receives a **signed
ticket**. It then opens the data-plane socket with it: `ws://host:8787/ws?ticket=<token>`.
The gameserver verifies the ticket and derives the trusted `{roomId, owner, seed,
playerCount}` from it, so a client can no longer claim another seat or a different seed.

**Ticket secret:** set `DDU_TICKET_SECRET` to the SAME value on both processes for any real
deployment — then a valid ticket is mandatory (invalid/absent → close `4401`). Unset, both
default to a shared insecure DEV secret (with a warning) and the gameserver *also* still
accepts the legacy raw-param handshake (`/ws?roomId=..&owner=..&seed=..&count=..`) for local
manual testing. Where the two services physically deploy is an ops call; the architecture split
(design/06) is settled.

**Gameserver address (ROADMAP 8.6, design/19 §6):** set `DDU_GAMESERVER_URL` on matchsvc so the
`wsUrl` it returns points at the data plane (default `ws://localhost:8787/ws`). It is read by
`GameRegistry`, not baked into the ticket — the ticket is a seat authorization and carries no
topology, so a seat granted while one instance was serving is redeemable against whichever instance
is current when it is presented. Today the registry holds only that configured address:
`register`/`heartbeat` exist as methods with **no HTTP route**, because a single-instance deployment
does not register at all. With no configured address and nothing registered, `/find`, `GET
/find/:queueId` and `/resume` answer **503 `{"error":"no gameserver available"}`** rather than
issuing a ticket with nowhere to redeem it.

**Billing (ROADMAP 8.3/8.4/8.5, design/19 §4/§5/§7):** `DDU_BILLING_DB_PATH` is billsvc's own SQLite
file and is deliberately a DIFFERENT variable from `DDU_DB_PATH` — one operator setting one
variable must not be able to point both planes at one file. `DDU_BILLING_DEV_STUB=1` enables the
`product:<sku>` receipt stub, which is what makes the whole create → pay → callback → delivered
chain drivable with no merchant account; under `NODE_ENV=production` it is ignored AND the process
refuses to start with it set. No Apple/Google/WeChat/Stripe credential exists in this project, so
those adapters return failure rather than granting anything (`DDU_APPLE_SHARED_SECRET`,
`DDU_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` + `DDU_GOOGLE_PACKAGE_NAME`, `DDU_WECHAT_MCH_ID` +
`DDU_WECHAT_API_V3_KEY`, `DDU_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` are read but cannot be verified) — and, since
8.5, cannot be reconciled against either. `DDU_BILLING_DEV_ORDERS` points at a JSON array of
platform orders that becomes the dev platform's own order book, which is what makes reconciliation
drivable at all with no merchant account; it is deliberately AUTHORED rather than derived from
`orders`, since a platform side computed from the local side could only ever report zero
differences. `DDU_GRANT_AUDIT_THRESHOLD` overrides the grant audit's per-account-per-day ceiling
(default 3; the comparison is `>`, so exactly at it is not an anomaly).

**Internal key (ROADMAP 8.1, design/19 §3):** set `DDU_INTERNAL_KEY` to the SAME value on
all three processes, the same way as the ticket secret and for the same reason — it is what the
gameserver presents on `POST /rating/report` and what billsvc presents on
`POST /internal/entitlements/grant`, both of which are INTERNAL routes and refuse anything
else. billsvc also needs `DDU_MATCHSVC_URL` to know where to deliver (default
`http://localhost:8788`); with it wrong or the control plane down, a settled purchase stays
`pending` in `deliveries` and is retried rather than lost. It is a **third** credential namespace, distinct from player sessions (`Authorization:
Bearer`) and from the ticket HMAC; an internal route never accepts a player token. Unset, it
falls back to a published insecure DEV key with a warning so the local two-process setup
works out of the box — **except under `NODE_ENV=production`, where an unset key means every
internal call is refused** rather than falling back to a key printed in this repository.
A refused settlement report is logged (room, attempt count, failure kind), so a missing key
shows up in the gameserver log rather than as a ladder that quietly stops moving.

**Exactly-once settlement (2026-09-05, design/19 §3):** the report carries a `reportKey`
(`{roomId}:{digest}`, from `ladderReport.ts`), and matchsvc claims it in `rating_reports`
inside the same transaction that moves the ratings — so the retry the paragraph above
describes can no longer double-credit a match. A redelivery is answered **200 with
`duplicate: true`** and not 409, because the sender counts every non-2xx a failure and would
otherwise log a failure for a report that landed *and* keep retrying it; a report whose apply
throws is answered 500, which is the one status that IS retried, and the claim has already
rolled back. A report with no `reportKey` at all (an older gameserver mid-deploy) is applied
the old, non-deduped way and logged — a 4xx is never retried, so refusing it would lose that
match's rating for good.

**Reconnect (design/06, wired end-to-end 2026-08-04):** the join handshake above only
ever succeeds while a room is still `WAITING` (filling seats) — a socket for a room
already `IN_MATCH` gets `4403` from that path. A dropped mid-match connection instead
calls `POST /resume {token}` with its *original* (by now likely expired) join ticket:
matchsvc re-verifies its signature while ignoring `exp` (proof the caller once
legitimately held that seat — a match runs far longer than a ticket's 30s TTL, so the
original can't just be redeemed again) and mints a fresh one for the same
`{roomId,owner,seed,playerCount,teamId,mode}`. The client then reopens `/ws?ticket=` with
that fresh ticket; the gameserver detects the room is already `IN_MATCH` (not `WAITING`)
and, instead of trying `join()`, waits for the client's own `{type:'resume', lastFrame}`
message, which `MatchRoom.resume()` answers with `conn_resync` (the frame log past
`lastFrame` + the current watermark) and resumes the metronome once every seat is back.
A resume against a room that's already settled/destroyed gets `{type:'error',
code:'resume_failed'}` instead of hanging silently. **This was dead code from 3.1 until
this pass** — `resume`/`conn_resync` existed and were unit-tested in isolation, but
nothing on the client ever called `resume`, and the handshake above would have rejected
the attempt anyway; a real disconnect just froze the match forever. See design/06's
"Mid-match reconnect" open question and `client/src/net/reconnect.ts`.

## Not in scope (by design)

Anti-cheat beyond the post-match `runHeadless` re-judge (design/06: full state is
client-held; casual-first PvP accepts maphack at launch), and PvP settlement/ELO (Phase 4).
The matchmaking here is deliberately minimal — a first-come queue keyed by seat count, no
**accounts/auth** (a ticket identifies a seat, not a user) and no **skill matching/MMR**.
Co-op is cooperative and latency-tolerant, so it is playable on the confirmed stream +
catch-up alone; **local prediction** (rendering your own movement/aim ahead of the confirmed
frame) shipped as a client-side render-layer concern on top (`client/src/game/controllers/LocalPredictor.ts`)
and never touches this data plane — the server stays the pure confirmed-frame relay.
