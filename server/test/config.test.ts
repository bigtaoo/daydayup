/**
 * Shared server config (ROADMAP 3.3) — `ticketSecret()`'s real-secret vs. dev-fallback
 * branches, and the one-time `console.warn` guarded by config.ts's module-scope `warned`
 * flag. That flag is module state, so each case that needs a FRESH flag does
 * `vi.resetModules()` + a dynamic re-import (mirrors this repo's other module-scope-state
 * tests) — sharing one imported `ticketSecret` across cases would leak the warned state
 * between them.
 *
 * **Rules 1 and 2 exist because this file went red once, in a full `npm run check`, and
 * never again in ~50 isolated and under-load re-runs (2026-08-25).** The cause was never
 * reproduced, but the test was structurally able to fail for reasons that have nothing to
 * do with `ticketSecret`, and that is fixed rather than left to recur:
 *
 *  1. **The console spy goes on AFTER the dynamic import, never before.** `src/config.ts`
 *     re-exports from `@dd/game/match/pvpConfig`, so `await import('../src/config')`
 *     evaluates a graph of ~104 modules. A spy installed before it is watching all of them,
 *     which turns `expect(warn).not.toHaveBeenCalled()` into "nothing in a 104-module graph
 *     warned" instead of "ticketSecret did not warn". Nothing in that graph warns at module
 *     scope today (checked), but the assertion should not depend on that staying true — or
 *     on vitest/Node never routing anything through `console.warn` during the await.
 *     `warnsLazily` below pins the property this relies on: the warning comes from the first
 *     `ticketSecret()` CALL, not from importing the module.
 *  2. **Assertions are about the ticket warning, not about console traffic in general.**
 *     `ticketWarnings()` filters to calls that actually mention `DDU_TICKET_SECRET`, so an
 *     unrelated warning from anywhere can neither fail a "does not warn" case nor pad the
 *     count in a "warns once" case.
 *  3. **The cold import is paid in `beforeAll`, not by whichever `it` runs first** — see the
 *     comment on that hook. That one is a 2026-08-26 addition, and unlike the two above it
 *     WAS reproduced and measured, 3 red runs in 20.

/**
 * Pay the module graph's COLD cost here, once, instead of billing it to whichever `it` runs
 * first. `import('../src/config')` reaches ~104 modules through `@dd/game/match/pvpConfig`,
 * and the first time a worker asks, vite has to transform all of them: measured 0.9s-8.1s on
 * one machine across 10 runs of `vitest run`, purely as a function of what else the run was
 * doing. Against vitest's 5000ms default `testTimeout` that made the FIRST test in this file
 * fail on 3 runs in 20 — always as a timeout, never as a failed assertion, and always the
 * first case, never the second one doing an identical `freshConfig()` right after it. In the
 * batch that measured both, the runs that went red were exactly the runs whose cold import
 * exceeded 5s.
 *
 * After this import, `freshConfig`'s `vi.resetModules()` + re-import costs ~50ms (the reset
 * discards evaluated modules, not vite's transform cache), so every case below finishes far
 * inside the default timeout and needs no timeout of its own. The explicit hook timeout is
 * sized for that one cold transform and nothing else — no test here waits on I/O, a timer,
 * or a network.
 *
 * Warming up is inert: `ticketSecret()` reads `process.env` and warns on CALL, not at module
 * scope (the `warns LAZILY` case at the bottom pins exactly that), so this import cannot
 * move any assertion below, and every case still gets its own fresh module instance.

 *
 *  1. It is what the server actually depends on. `matchsvc.ts` and `index.ts` both import
 *     this module at boot, and a module-scope capture would make the secret depend on
 *     whether whatever loads the environment ran before that import — the failure being a
 *     process that signs real tickets with the DEV secret while looking correctly
 *     configured, which is the exact posture this file exists to defend.
 *  2. It is the property that makes the `beforeAll` warm-up above sound. That import runs
 *     under the ambient environment, before any case has set anything, so if the env were
 *     read at import time the warm-up would be a behaviour change and not just a cost.
 *     Pinned here rather than trusted, the same way `warns LAZILY` pins the sibling
 *     property for the console warning.
