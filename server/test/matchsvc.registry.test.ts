/**
 * matchsvc × `GameRegistry` (ROADMAP 8.6, design/19 §6) — the wiring, over a real
 * `node:http` server on an ephemeral port.
 *
 * `GameRegistry.test.ts` proves the lookup; this file proves the three things only the
 * assembly can be wrong about, none of which any unit test of either side would notice:
 *
 *  1. **`/find`'s `wsUrl` comes from the registry, not from a constant.** The pre-8.6 code
 *     closed over `GAMESERVER_URL` and stamped it unconditionally, and every existing HTTP
 *     test asserts `/^ws:\/\//` — which a hardcoded URL satisfies forever.
 *  2. **The ticket never learns the topology.** The chosen URL travels in the response and
 *     the signed payload has no gameserver field at all, so the same seat grant redeems
 *     against whatever instance is current when it is presented (design/19 §6 supersedes
 *     the earlier "put a gameserver id inside the ticket" sketch — `ticket.ts` is untouched).
 *  3. **No instance is a refusal, not an `undefined`.** `MatchInfo.wsUrl` is non-optional on
 *     the client, so a match object issued without one would fail nowhere near here — it
 *     would surface as a socket opened on `undefined?ticket=…`. Every route answers 503,
 *     and the poll route answers it BEFORE `Matchmaker.poll` deletes the waiter.
 *
 * The registry is injected because the single-instance branch is the only one a real
 * deployment can produce today: a full, stale, or absent gameserver has no route to create
 * it through until register/heartbeat are built.
