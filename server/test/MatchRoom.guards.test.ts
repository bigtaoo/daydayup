/**
 * MatchRoom's REFUSAL arms — every early `return` that says "no, not from you, not now".
 *
 * Sibling to `MatchRoom.test.ts`, which drives the happy lifecycle (join → launch → relay →
 * settle) and, measured 2026-09-03, left this room at 99.08% LINES and 83.14% BRANCHES. That
 * gap is the whole argument for gating branches as well as lines: the lines these guards live
 * on all execute — it is only ever the taken side that runs, so every "wrong caller, wrong
 * phase, wrong seat" arm was unexercised while the file read as fully covered.
 *
 * These are not defensive nice-to-haves. `submitCmd`/`reportResult`/`reportCheckpoint` are
 * driven straight off the wire by whatever a client sends, so each guard is a trust boundary:
 * losing one means a settled room accepting a second settlement, a spectator's seat index
 * moving someone else's player, or a checkpoint vote arriving from a seat that is not in the
 * match. None of those throws — they quietly corrupt a live match.
