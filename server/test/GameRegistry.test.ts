/**
 * `GameRegistry` (ROADMAP 8.6, design/19 §6) — the topology lookup behind `/find`'s
 * `wsUrl`.
 *
 * Only one branch of this class is reachable in production today (the configured static
 * single instance; the register/heartbeat routes are deliberately unbuilt), which is
 * exactly why it needs unit tests rather than only the HTTP ones in
 * `matchsvc.registry.test.ts`: everything else here is shape being kept honest until the
 * day something drives it, and shape that nothing checks rots into a "constant wrapped in
 * a class". The cases below are therefore aimed at the *decisions* recorded in the class
 * header, not at line coverage:
 *
 *  - the static fallback is a FALLBACK, not a competing entry (it must lose to any healthy
 *    registered instance, and it must never expire);
 *  - `pick` ranks on load RATIO, not absolute load, and treats full as skipped rather than
 *    merely last;
 *  - a heartbeat for an unknown id writes NOTHING, because a heartbeat that re-registered
 *    would mask a failed startup registration;
 *  - `null` is a real answer with no instance and no fallback, and `STALE_MS` is the number
 *    the default staleness window actually uses.
