/**
 * The daily non-`purchase` entitlement audit, as a CLI (design/19 §7, ROADMAP 8.5).
 *
 *   npm run audit:grants -w server -- [--day=2026-09-04] [--days=1] [--threshold=3] [--dry-run]
 *
 * TWO DATABASES, OPENED DIFFERENTLY ON PURPOSE:
 *
 *   the ACCOUNT file (`DDU_DB_PATH`)      opened READ-ONLY. `entitlements` is the table this
 *                                         audit is judging, and the whole posture is that it
 *                                         observes and files — so it must not hold a
 *                                         connection that could change what it is looking at.
 *                                         SQLite enforces that; a comment would not.
 *   the BILLING file (`DDU_BILLING_DB_PATH`) opened read-write, for `review_queue` alone.
 *
 * design/19 §7 rules out an admin service, so this is a script rather than a route — and it is
 * deliberately NOT mounted on matchsvc, which is a parallel workstream's file. All the logic is
 * in `src/grantAudit.ts`, which is pure and tested; this is argument parsing and printing.
 *
 * ═══ FILES, NEVER ACTS ═══ Nothing below revokes, suspends or flags anything. It writes rows
 * to a queue a human works. Re-running it over a day that was already filed produces nothing,
 * because `(accountId, dayKey)` is the queue's idempotency key — an audit an operator is
 * afraid to re-run is an audit that stops being run.
