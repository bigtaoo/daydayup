/**
 * Daily reconciliation, as a CLI (design/19-server-platform.md §7, ROADMAP 8.5).
 *
 *   npm run reconcile -w server -- [--days=1] [--platforms=dev,stripe] [--strict]
 *
 * A script and not a route, because design/19 §7 ends with "No admin service" and adding one
 * to the control plane to hold a cron job would be building exactly the thing that section
 * declines. All the logic is in `src/billsvc/reconcile.ts`, which is pure and tested; this
 * file is argument parsing, wiring and printing, and lives under `scripts/` where neither the
 * coverage gate nor the file-length check reaches — deliberately, because there is nothing
 * here worth asserting that is not already asserted next to the logic.
 *
 * WHAT IT CAN ACTUALLY VERIFY TODAY, said plainly. No merchant account exists on Apple,
 * Google, WeChat or Stripe (design/19 §9), so those four ports return not-implemented and land
 * in `unreconciled`. The run then prints INCOMPLETE, which is the honest answer and not a
 * failure of this script. The `dev` platform is the one that can genuinely reconcile, against
 * the order book named by `DDU_BILLING_DEV_ORDERS` — a JSON array of `PlatformOrder`, authored
 * rather than derived from the local tables, which is what makes a difference it reports mean
 * something.
 *
 * Environment: `DDU_BILLING_DB_PATH` (the billing file), `DDU_BILLING_DEV_STUB` (must be on for
 * the dev platform to answer at all), `DDU_BILLING_DEV_ORDERS` (path to the dev order book).
