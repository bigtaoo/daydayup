# Gameplay: core loop, modes, parry

What the player actually does. This is the single source of truth for the **core loop**, the **two modes** (PvE search-fight-extract / PvP arena), the **survivability model (HP + shield)**, the **weapon-slot & material economy**, and how **parry (block/deflect)** sits inside all of it. It builds on the weapon system (`03-weapon-system.md`), the entity model (`02-entity-model.md`), and must stay consistent with the netcode decisions already locked in `06-netcode-determinism.md` — especially **casual-first PvP** and **ephemeral in-run power (materials are the only thing that leaves a run)**.

## The decisions (locked)

- **Two separate modes, not one blended activity.** PvE is a **co-op search-fight-extract run** (threat is AI only); PvP is an **independent PvPvE arena** (threat is other players **and** AI). They do **not** share a map, and PvP players **never intrude on a PvE run** — the two are entirely different activities.
- **PvE adopts an extraction loot loop — but a softened, PvE-only form.** You search for loot, push deeper for better rewards, and choose when to bank and leave. What makes this *not* the rejected extraction-shooter (below): **weapons never persist regardless** (they vanish at run end no matter what — there is nothing to "lose"), **only materials extract**, the threat is **AI only** (no rival players hunting you), and death costs only **this floor's un-banked materials** (extraction points are checkpoints). It keeps extraction's push-your-luck tension without its casual-hostile "lose your hard-won gear to a stranger" sting.
- **Weapons are ephemeral; materials are the only carry-out.** Every weapon — brought in or found — is wiped at run end. The single thing that leaves a run is **materials**, the meta-forge currency (`meta` doc, later). This *is* `06`'s "in-run resources are engine state, wiped each match," made literal.
- **PvP normalizes gear via unified presets.** The arena offers a **fixed, balanced set of preset loadouts** everyone picks from — players do **not** bring or clamp their own gear. Matches are decided by skill and in-match choices, not by who has ground more. This is the concrete meaning of `06`'s "casual-first."
- **Meta sells breadth, not a PvP power ladder.** Persistent progression (spent via material forging + purchase) grants **weapon-blueprint breadth** (PvE-only — crafted weapons never reach PvP) and a **side-grade character roster** (the one meta axis in PvP, no all-rounder). It never grants a raw power ladder that reaches PvP. In-run finds are the real power axis. Full model in `14`.
- **Parry is melee-category-limited.** Only melee weapons can deflect, and deflect is part of the swing itself — not a separate block (`03`). Choosing a ranged loadout means giving up parry — it is a genuine trade-off, not a universal skill everyone owns.
- **Landscape-primary.** The game ships **landscape only**; portrait is dropped. Twin-stick + corner buttons (`04`) need the horizontal space, and WeChat supports `deviceOrientation: "landscape"` in `game.json`.

### Why this extraction form, and not full extraction

The original plan rejected extraction wholesale; we adopted a **narrow slice** of it. The distinction is what each column below turns on:

| Model | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| **PvE search-fight-extract (adopted): AI-only, weapons never persist, materials-only carry-out, per-floor checkpoint** | ✓ Keeps the push-your-luck "bank now or dive deeper" tension, but sidesteps every original objection: nothing persistent is ever lost (weapons were always ephemeral), no rival-player intrusion, and PvE co-op on the deterministic engine (`06`) has no open-world player-state netcode load or client-full-state maphack surface. |
| Full extraction (shared dungeon, **PvP intrusion**, **lose persistent gear** on death) | ✗ Maximal tension but head-on collision with casual-first; "lose the gear you ground for" is the opposite of casual. Heaviest netcode load (open-world player state), and the maphack weakness of client-held full state (`06`) hurts most exactly here. The adopted form keeps none of these. |
| PvP carries full meta gear (RPG PvP) | ✗ Vertical meta would leak straight into PvP → veterans crush newcomers / pay-to-win. Rejected together with the "horizontal meta" decision. |

## Core loop (PvE search-fight-extract run)

One run, floor-based push-your-luck:

```
Loadout (bring up to 2 weapons; every free slot filled by kind — a run always carries a gun + a melee weapon)
   → enter floor 1 (seeded)
      → clear (some of) its rooms: fight, open chests, pick up weapons & materials
      → reach this floor's EXTRACTION ROOM
         → choose: EXTRACT (bank everything, run ends, keep materials)
                 or DESCEND (materials so far are locked in — deeper = better)
   → repeat for ~5 floors; the last floor's boss room IS its extraction room
      (portal opens only after the boss dies)
   → run ends (extracted / boss-cleared / dead)
      → all weapons wiped; banked materials kept; meta advances via forging
   → back to loadout
```

- **Weapons found this run are the moment-to-moment power fantasy — and all of it is ephemeral.** The kit you build this run — a better weapon (higher rarity, or a frame×element that counters the room, `03`) plus **run-scoped buffs** (the in-run power layer, Soul-Knight style; there are no weapon affixes, `14`) — is wiped at run end. This is `06`'s "in-run resources/drops are engine state, wiped each match."
- **Materials are the only carry-out**, and the deeper you go the better they get. Weapon *finds* stay random at every depth — depth buys material quality, not guaranteed weapons.
- **Extraction rooms are checkpoints.** One per floor; reaching it lets you **extract** (end the run, keep everything) or **descend**. Choosing to descend banks your materials so far, so a death on a later floor costs only **that floor's** un-banked materials (weapons are gone either way). This is the softened extraction form (locked decisions above).
- **You need not clear a floor.** How many rooms you can skip depends on where that floor's extraction room sits — an extraction room mid-floor lets you leave one or two rooms unfought, a natural "greed for the last chest vs. leave safe" micro-decision.
- **Floor count is tentatively 5**, each with **5–10 rooms**; the deepest floor's challenge is a boss whose room doubles as the final extraction (portal after the kill). Exact counts are to-tune (below).
- **Co-op:** same run, cooperative, latency-tolerant, AI-only threat. Starts single-player on `LocalInputSource` to validate feel, then the same `NetInputSource` broadcast for co-op (`06`). Enemy/boss AI runs inside the deterministic engine off injected PRNG, identical on every client. **Downed teammates can be revived** — a free, ~15 s stationary channel by another player (`07`/`08` interaction); revive/team-wipe edge rules in open questions. **Outside combat, squadmates need not share a room** — a floor's rooms are co-resident (below), so the party can split up to loot/scout different rooms in parallel; entering combat instantly regroups everyone into the triggering room (below).

### Dungeon generation

- **Hybrid: hand-authored room pieces stitched by a seeded procedural layout.** Reuse funny's PRNG roomgen for the layout/selection; keep encounter quality controlled by curating the room pieces. Standard roguelite answer — full-procedural risks uneven quality, fully hand-built kills replayability. The per-floor **extraction room** is one of the placed pieces, and its position within the floor is what gates how many rooms are skippable.
- Generation is driven by an **injected `Prng` seeded per run** (`06`), so a run is fully reproducible from `seed + input stream` (needed for co-op determinism and headless re-judge).
- ✅ **Selection shipped 2026-07-24 (ROADMAP 1.3, `09`):** `world/dungeon.ts generateFloor` draws a floor's room count + normal-piece sequence from `roomgenPrng`, always ending in the floor's extraction/boss capstone. Placing a generated floor into a live, traversable run (the room-to-room "which rooms are skippable" experience this bullet describes) is 1.4/1.5.

### Room & door model (locked 2026-08-04)

Supersedes `09`'s "automatic teleport to the next room's spawn, never walk through a door" note: a floor's rooms are now a real door graph, not a strict single-room sequence.

✅ **Engine shipped 2026-08-04 (`ENGINE_VERSION` 34, see `09` for the schema):** everything below is live — `world/dungeon.ts` `placeFloor`/`carveDoorGaps`/`buildFloorGeometry` place a generated floor's rooms along a west→east spine (the MVP placement shape; a real 2D graph layout stays a follow-up) and stitch them into one co-resident world; the new `DoorSystem` (step 11.5) owns activation, lock/unlock, and force-regroup.

✅ **Client rendering shipped 2026-08-04 (same-day follow-up):** `HudView.ts`'s floor/room
line was fixed first (reads `roomId` via `dungeonRoomIndexById`, no more single global
"current room"). The actual scene render followed: `RoomBuilder` already drew a whole
floor's stitched geometry in one pass (camera-cull did the rest, see the corrected bullet
below), so the real gap was doors — they now render as a real fixture per
`state.dungeonDoors` entry (`art/environment/door_{locked,open}_raw.png`, loaded via
`render/environmentSprites.ts`), excluded from the generic wall fill by reference identity,
leaf-swappable in place on `door_locked`/`door_unlocked` (no full room rebuild).
**Standing since 2026-08-20** (`scene/doorRender.ts`): those two files are front elevations and
were being laid flat on `layers.ground`, so a door was the only thing left in the room painted on
the floor. A door is now built as a wall block whose face is an opening — cap continuous with the
runs either side, the leaf standing in that opening at the height of the wall it is cut into, and
the whole fixture registered with the occlusion x-ray like any other standing block. See
`01-rendering.md` "A door is a wall block whose face is an opening".
`EventReactor` also reacts to `force_regroup` (`Scene.player.snap()` so the camera cuts to
the teleport instead of panning).

✅ **Fully-realized branching shipped 2026-08-05 (`ENGINE_VERSION` 35):** `layout:'branching'`
no longer resolves its candidate at generation time via a wraparound-offset PRNG perturbation
(the scope cut both passes above deferred) — a `'branching'` floor now gets **one real
fork-and-reconverge diamond**: `world/dungeon.ts generateFloor` draws which interior
normal-stage transition forks (never the very first room, so spawn stays a single ordinary
room), then resolves that stage to `branchFactor` DISTINCT, same-width sibling `RoomPiece`s
(clamped to however many the pool actually offers — a graceful degrade to a plain single room,
not a throw, when the pool has no same-width match). `placeFloor` places those siblings
**side-by-side** (same X, stacked in Y with a gap, centered on the fork point's own vertical
center) directly east of the fork-point room, and connects each sibling's own door onward
into the very next stage's room (an ordinary room or the capstone) — the reconvergence, with
no separate merge-room concept needed in the data model. This is a real walk-through-the-door
choice now: both siblings are real, simultaneously-live `PlacedRoom`s with their own
`DoorRuntime`/combat-lock/force-regroup state, exercised through the unmodified `DoorSystem`/
`RoomBuilder`/`EventReactor` (all already topology-agnostic — this pass needed zero client
changes). Deliberate scope cuts, not data-model limits (`Door`/`PlacedRoom` already support an
arbitrary graph, same as PvP's `ArenaMap`): only one fork per floor (no fork-into-fork
chaining), and a fork's siblings must share their pool piece's exact width (so their shared
east boundary lines up with one merge-room X, reusing `pickDoorAnchor`'s existing adjacency
assumption unmodified). No shipped content used `'branching'` at the time this shipped
(`EMBER_DUNGEON` was `'linear'`) — authoring same-width `EMBER_ROOMS` variants to make a fork
visible in the shipped biome was left as a content task. **Update, 2026-08-05 same day, "graph2d
content" pass below:** `EMBER_DUNGEON` switched to `'graph2d'` instead, so `'branching'` still
stays unused by this config — see that pass's own note on why (`ember_atrium`'s deliberately
unique width). The known side effect it
introduced — the client's `FloorProgress` HUD track computed done/current/upcoming purely
from `dungeonRooms` array index, which wasn't meaningful once a floor has siblings — is
resolved by the minimap adapter below, same-day.

✅ **PvE minimap adapter shipped 2026-08-05 (same-day follow-up):** `FloorProgress`/
`floorProgressMath.ts` are deleted — PvE now shares the exact same `Minimap` widget PvP
already had (`client/src/game/ui/Minimap.ts`), via two new pure functions in
`minimapLayout.ts`: `dungeonToArenaMap` converts `PlacedRoom[]`/`DoorRuntime[]` into the
same `ArenaMap` shape `computeMinimapLayout` already consumes (`Door` needs no remapping —
it's the same type PvP uses; room offsets are normalized to a non-negative origin, since a
fork's siblings can have negative `offsetYGrid`), and `dungeonRoomStatus` extends the
existing `safe`/`closing`/`danger` tint with a new `unvisited` bucket — exactly the state an
untaken fork sibling needs, closing the `FloorProgress` gap named above rather than just
working around it. `Minimap.update()` no longer hardcodes PvP's zone semantics: it takes a
`statusOf` resolver the caller supplies, so the one Pixi widget stays mode-agnostic. Also
shows other online players' rooms in PvE now (reusing `Minimap`'s existing player-dot
rendering as-is), which `FloorProgress` never could (it only ever showed the local
player's own linear position). No engine changes, no `ENGINE_VERSION` bump — purely a
client-side adapter over data the engine already exposed.

✅ **Real 2D graph layout shipped 2026-08-05 (ROADMAP "real 2D graph layout"
follow-up, additive, no `ENGINE_VERSION` bump):** closes the one remaining
scope cut the 2026-08-04 engine bullet named above — a *generated* (not
hand-authored) floor is no longer forced onto a west→east spine. A new third
`DungeonConfig.layout: 'graph2d'` (alongside `'linear'`/`'branching'`) pairs
`generateFloor`'s UNCHANGED stage-selection stream (it never forks, so every
stage stays a plain `RoomPiece`, matching `'linear'`'s own selection exactly)
with a new `world/dungeon.ts placeFloorGraph2d` — a sibling to `placeFloor`,
not a variant of it, same precedent as `placeAuthoredFloor`. Each transition
walks out of whichever of the previous room's exits is both unconsumed (not
the one already used entering it) and has a matching opposite exit on the next
piece; `roomgenPrng` draws a direction only when more than one is viable (the
same "only draw when it matters" discipline `combatPrng`'s crit draw already
established) — so a west/east-only content pool places exactly like `'linear'`'s
own spine for every stage after the first, and only a piece with a free
north/south exit (or an ambiguous first room) actually lets the floor bend.
Throws (fail loud, design/09) if a placement would overlap an earlier room —
a real risk once placement can walk in any of 4 directions, unlike
`placeFloor`'s single-axis spine where it structurally cannot happen; this
module does not try to auto-avoid it, same "curated content, not a solver"
contract `placeFloor` itself already assumes. No shipped `DungeonConfig` used
`'graph2d'` at the time this shipped (`EMBER_DUNGEON` was `'linear'`) — authoring
content with real north/south exits to make a shipped biome actually bend was
left as a content task, same "no shipped content exercises it yet" note
`'branching'` and hand-authored floors both shipped with. **Update, 2026-08-05
same day, "graph2d content" pass below: `EMBER_DUNGEON` now IS `'graph2d'`,
closing this gap.** 16 new tests
(`dungeon.test.ts`'s `placeFloorGraph2d`/graph2d-`generateFloor` unit
coverage + a `dungeonrun.test.ts` end-to-end integration block).

**"加测试" follow-up, same day:** closed the coverage gaps a first pass left —
`entranceFromDoor`'s reuse inside `placeFloorGraph2d` itself (not just
`placeAuthoredFloor`, which already covered the function directly) now has
dedicated east/west AND north/south assertions, plus the spawn room's own
inset/size-half fallback when it authors no player spawn; a door-anchor
"not pinned to one position" spread check (`placeFloor`'s own existing
convention) now has a `graph2d` counterpart for both an east- and a
south-going connection; a `roomA`/`roomB` chain-order assertion across a
3-room stretch; and — closing the sharpest gap, since the module doc's own
central claim is "a direction is drawn ONLY when more than one exit is
viable" — a `CountingPrng` test subclass that asserts the EXACT draw count
per door (1 when only one direction is viable, 2 when a real choice exists),
not just that the output varies. `dungeonrun.test.ts` also gained a
forced, seed-independent SOUTH-bending floor (every other dungeon fixture in
that file only ever produces an east-going/vertical door) to prove
`buildFloorGeometry`'s carving and `DoorSystem` activation genuinely handle a
horizontal (north/south-wall) door end-to-end, not just in the pure
placement-function tests above. 8 new tests (6 `dungeon.test.ts` + 2
`dungeonrun.test.ts`) — 1647 total across all 7 workspaces, `tsc --noEmit`
clean.

✅ **"graph2d content" pass shipped 2026-08-05 (same day, additive, no `ENGINE_VERSION`
bump):** closes the "no shipped content exercises it yet" gap both the branching and
graph2d bullets above left open — `EMBER_DUNGEON.layout` switches from `'linear'` to
`'graph2d'`, so a generated Ember floor can now genuinely bend north/south, not just walk
a west→east spine. `world/rooms/ember.ts` gained a 5th normal piece, `ember_atrium` (a
fully open room, all 4 exits, deliberately a unique width so `'branching'` still stays
unused by this config — only same-width normal pieces are fork-eligible), and
`ember_pillars` gained `north`+`south` on top of its existing `west`+`east` — alongside
the pre-existing all-4-exit `ember_cross`, that's 3 of 5 normal pieces now able to bend a
floor. `generateFloor`'s stage-selection stream is unchanged (module doc,
`world/dungeon.ts`), so no past seed's room SEQUENCE changes — only placement.

Two real bugs surfaced by testing, not inspection, both now fixed (full account in
`world/rooms/ember.ts`'s own module doc): (1) a **dead end** — the spawn room's
undocumented freedom to walk `'west'` (module doc above) could exhaust a plain
west/east piece's only remaining exit before it ever reached the original `west`-only
capstone, which had no `east` to receive it; fixed by giving `ember_extraction`/
`ember_boss` `east` too. (2) Once (1) was fixed and a 3-room floor became reachable, a
**fold-back overlap** — `ember_boss` (22×18, the pool's largest piece) connecting via
`west` or `east` centers on the previous room's centerline and can overhang past it into
whatever sits on the OTHER side; fixed by giving both capstones full 4-exit symmetry AND
a new engine-side **direction-retry** in `placeFloorGraph2d` (`world/dungeon.ts`): when
the drawn direction's placement would overlap an already-placed room, it now falls back
through every OTHER viable direction (fixed order, no extra PRNG draw) before giving up —
strictly reactive (only ever checks rooms already placed, never looks ahead a stage), so
it changes nothing for any placement that never overlapped in the first place. Verified
both by a real-seed sweep (mirroring `SpawnSystem`'s own `generateFloor`→
`placeFloorGraph2d` draw sequence) AND, since the failure space is small and finite
(`EMBER_DUNGEON.roomsPerFloor` caps a floor at 3 rooms), an EXHAUSTIVE enumeration over
every `(normal1, normal2, capstone)` triple the real pool can produce — confirmed zero
failures, not just "rarer than N seeds." 10 new engine tests (`dungeon.test.ts`'s
EMBER_DUNGEON bend/straight/exhaustive coverage + the direction-retry unit test +
`dungeonrun.test.ts`'s live bending-seed end-to-end check) — 1678 total across all 7
workspace packages, `tsc --noEmit` clean.

✅ **Bug fix pass shipped 2026-08-12 (`ENGINE_VERSION` 36):** two real bugs found from a
live player report ("cleared the room, door's unlocked, still can't walk through it"),
not by inspection — both real replay-affecting changes for `EMBER_DUNGEON` (`'graph2d'`
since the "graph2d content" pass above). (1) `DeathDropsSystem`'s `onDeathSpawn` boss-adds
(e.g. `BLIGHTLORD`'s two basic adds) never inherited the dying boss's own `roomId`, unlike
`SpawnSystem.dispatchDungeonSpawns`'s existing "set `roomId` DIRECTLY, same tick" fix for
the identical class of bug — `DoorSystem`'s `hasLiveEnemy` scan (step 11.5, same tick)
skips any enemy with `roomId===undefined`, so a boss room's door would briefly unlock the
instant the boss died, then re-lock (and force-regroup the player straight back) the very
next tick once `EnvironmentSystem` caught up — a real, if narrow, "door opens, then slams
shut and yanks you back" window. Fixed: the minion now inherits `e.roomId` at spawn time,
same tick, same as the wave-spawn path. (2) `placeFloorGraph2d`'s `'north'`/`'west'` hops
off the spawn room (pinned at the origin) could place the next room at a NEGATIVE offset
— `buildFloorGeometry`'s `worldW`/`worldH` is a running max seeded at 0 (blind to negative
extents) and `MovementSystem.clampToWorld` hard-clamps to `[margin, worldW - margin]` with
no bound below 0, so a player could never physically reach (or fully cross into) a
negative-offset room even though its door had correctly unlocked — the minimap's own
`dungeonToArenaMap` normalization (note above, "room offsets are normalized to a
non-negative origin") had already worked around this for RENDERING, but the actual
walkable-world bounds were never fixed. Fixed: `placeFloorGraph2d` now shifts the WHOLE
floor by the same delta so the minimum offset on each axis lands at exactly 0 — a pure
translation, every relative adjacency stays intact; `'linear'`/`'branching'` never produce
a negative offset and this is a deliberate no-op for them. 2 new regression tests
(`engine/systems/doors.test.ts`, `engine/world/dungeon.test.ts`) — 2631 tests green across
all 7 workspace packages, `tsc --noEmit` clean.

See `ROADMAP.md`'s "Room & door model" section for the full file list — including
hand-authored PvE floor placement (map editor), shipped 2026-08-05, see the
"Hand-authored PvE floors" subsection below.

- **A floor's rooms are all simultaneously live in sim, matching PvP's co-resident `ArenaMap`** — not generated on entry. The tick advances uniformly across every room regardless of who is rendering what (determinism needs the same input → same result everywhere, not "no one is watching so skip it"); what presence gates is enemy AI *behavior*, not the tick. A room that no player has entered yet ("not activated") still ticks forward but runs no walk/attack logic on its enemies — they sit inert until a player activates the room. A cleared room never respawns enemies, including on backtrack.
- **Doors connect rooms bidirectionally and are freely walkable within a floor.** This reuses `content/arenas.ts`'s `Door{roomA, roomB, passageGrid}` shape rather than inventing a separate PvE type — a PvE floor is the same "room graph with explicit door adjacency" primitive PvP already has. Backtracking to an earlier room in the same floor is allowed, at any time, no penalty.
- **"In combat" is derived state, not an authored flag: any room with a live (uncleared) enemy in it.** A combat room's doors lock **as a unit** — every door on that room, not just the one nearest a player — the instant it has a live enemy, and unlock together the instant the last one dies. This generalizes the existing boss-room rule ("portal opens only after the kill" is now just this rule's boss-room instance, not a special case).
- **Entering combat force-regroups the whole online run.** The instant a room's encounter starts, every other online player is teleported instantly to that room's entrance — an immediate placement, not a walk, and not optional; there is no "stay behind" choice. This hard-interrupts whatever a teleported player was doing: an open weapon-pickup panel just closes (the weapon stays on the floor to grab later), an in-progress revive channel cancels and the downed teammate stays down (the same "release INTERACT / move out of range" cancel the revive channel already has — teleport is just one more cancel source). Once the fight clears, ordinary backtracking lets a player return and finish what they were doing.
- **Doors are always-present physical fixtures with exactly two visual states, locked/open** — never a bare gap in the wall. `art/environment/door_{locked,open}_raw.png` are the first accepted pair (`13`'s flat-cel direction: a hazard-saturated glowing barrier when locked, a desaturated inert frame when open). Both are front elevations and are drawn STANDING in the wall's own opening (`01`, 2026-08-20), with the locked state carrying an additive hazard bloom on the floor in front of it — the read a player needs from across the room, and the only read a kerb-height doorway has, since it may not stand tall enough for its silhouette to carry one.
- **Door position is authored freely, not wall-centered.** A door's `passageGrid` is an arbitrary rect along its wall, exactly like PvP's `Door` — "~5 positions per wall" is a snapping aid for the map editor / a safe candidate set `generateFloor` draws from, not a constraint baked into the data shape. The one thing that IS baked in (`ENGINE_VERSION` 44, 2026-08-20): the rect sits on **whole grid cells**, like every `solids` rect already does. Freely-positioned never meant sub-cell — `carveDoorGaps` cuts whatever the rect says, so a half-cell passage leaves the wall run past it half-cell deep, and four runs in shipped level-1 content stood 16 px deep that way under a 104 px-tall perimeter (the worst case for `01`'s standing-wall tones, and the geometry that made the occlusion x-ray need its face-fading pass). Both placement functions snap their drawn anchor (`world/dungeon/doorAnchor.ts`) and the map editor's save gate rejects a hand-typed fractional one.
- **Rendering matches PvP's own approach: the whole co-resident floor is drawn in one pass, not just the local player's current room** (corrected 2026-08-04 — the original "single-room" framing here didn't match what either mode actually does or needs). `RoomBuilder` builds every room's geometry from the floor's stitched `state.walls`/`obstacles` at once; the camera following the local player is what keeps the *screen* showing only their vicinity, exactly like PvP's ~60-room arena. A minimap remains the only place teammates' rooms/clear-state surface at a glance (`10`).
- **Cross-floor transitions are unaffected and stay one-way** — the extraction/descend portal between floors remains irreversible (the "forward-only" decision in Open questions below is unchanged); only navigation *within* a floor gained the door graph.
- **Descending abandons the rest of the floor, enemies included** ✅ **(fixed 2026-08-15, `ENGINE_VERSION` 39).** A consequence of co-residency that the original cutover missed. Under the old one-room-at-a-time model, reaching the checkpoint meant the floor was empty by construction; under this model the checkpoint asks only that the **capstone** room be activated-and-clear (`ExtractionSystem.capstoneCleared`), and never asks where the player is standing — so a floor can be holding live enemies elsewhere the tick DESCEND resolves. Two routes reach that state today: a room with a late `atTick` `WaveScript` entry re-populates itself after the player cleared it and walked on (force-regroup drags the player back, but does *not* retract the checkpoint), and an enemy in genuinely un-owned space between rooms has `roomId === undefined`, which `DoorSystem`'s scan skips entirely — so it locks no door and sets no `hasLiveEnemy`. `resolveDescend` used to leave `state.enemies`/`state.projectiles` standing while tearing down every room array around them, so those enemies rode into the next floor holding a `roomId` nothing recognised and a position measured against geometry that no longer existed. With level 1's hand-authored floors (5/6/7/6/5 rooms at 15–30 enemies each) that is on the order of a hundred enemies per floor for a player who beelines the capstone. Both arrays are now cleared with the rest of the floor, on the same "the geometry it stood on is gone" reasoning that already applied to `pickups`. **They simply vanish — no deaths, no drops, no score**: you get nothing for the rooms you skipped, which is the intended reading of "descend and leave the rest behind", and it keeps `dropPrng` untouched so the run stays replay-stable. See `ROADMAP.md`'s "Stranded enemies rode the DESCEND into the next floor" section.

### Hand-authored PvE floors ✅ (2026-08-05)

Closes the "map-editor door placement" gap named above: before this, the ONLY way a
PvE floor got built was `generateFloor`/`placeFloor` drawing rooms and door positions
from `roomgenPrng` — there was no way to hand-place a specific `RoomPiece` at a
specific position with a door at a specific position, the same way PvP's `ArenaMap`
already lets an author hand-place a room and a door (`content/arenas.ts`). Locked and
shipped same day.

- **A new `DungeonFloorMap` content type, analogous to PvP's `ArenaMap`.**
  `{id, rooms: {id, pieceId, offsetXGrid, offsetYGrid}[], doors: Door[]}` —
  `Door` is the exact same type PvP's `ArenaMap` already uses, so a hand-placed
  PvE door is no different a shape from a hand-placed PvP one. A room entry
  references a piece from the SAME `RoomPiece` library `generateFloor` already
  draws from, by `pieceId` — a hand-authored floor is not a separate content
  vocabulary, just a different way of arranging the existing one.
- **Array order carries meaning, reusing the two single-index assumptions
  already baked into the engine** (`SpawnSystem`'s `placed[0]` for the run's
  initial spawn, `ExtractionSystem`'s `dungeonRoomRuntime[length-1]` for the
  capstone/extraction check) rather than inventing a third, parallel "which
  room is special" mechanism: `rooms[0]` is the entrance/spawn room, `rooms[last]`
  is the capstone (extraction/boss) room. The map editor's validator enforces
  both ends before allowing a save.
- **New `world/dungeon.ts placeAuthoredFloor(map, library)`, a sibling to
  `placeFloor`, not a variant of it.** Resolves each room's `pieceId` against
  the library (fail-loud on a missing piece, same "fail loud, never at use"
  convention as `generateFloor`'s own missing-capstone check), passes `doors`
  straight through unchanged (no PRNG draw — a hand-authored door's position IS
  its authored `passageGrid`, nothing left to roll), and computes each
  non-entrance room's `entranceGrid` from whichever connecting door reaches it
  first in `doors` array order (same tie-break `placeFloor` already uses for a
  fork's merge room), inset into the room along whichever axis the door's
  passage is narrower on — generalizing `ENTRANCE_INSET_GRID`'s existing
  west-only inset, which only worked because a generated floor's spine is
  always west→east; a hand-authored floor's doors can sit on any of a room's
  four walls, matching PvP's own `ArenaCanvas` door tool. Returns the exact same
  `{placed: PlacedRoom[], doors: Door[]}` shape `placeFloor` does, so
  `buildFloorGeometry` and every system downstream of it (`DoorSystem`,
  `RoomBuilder`, `EventReactor`, the minimap adapter) needs zero changes — the
  same "already topology-agnostic" property the branching pass already
  confirmed for those systems.
- **`DungeonConfig` gains an optional `floorMaps?: Partial<Record<number,
  DungeonFloorMap>>`** — a per-floor-index override. `SpawnSystem` checks it
  first; a floor index absent from `floorMaps` still draws from
  `generateFloor`/`placeFloor`'s PRNG stream exactly as today. A biome can mix
  hand-authored and procedural floors in the same run (e.g. a hand-authored
  floor 0 as a tuned opening floor, procedural floors after it) — this is a
  per-floor override, never a per-room patch of an otherwise-generated floor.
- **Map editor gains a third mode, "PvE Dungeon Floor," alongside the existing
  "PvE Room Library"/"PvP Arena" (`tools/map-editor`)** — not a new tool.
  Reuses `ArenaCanvas`'s move/resize-reject-overlap/pan/zoom/door-connect-tool
  machinery as-is; the one real difference is what "place a room" means: an
  `ArenaMap` room is freehand-drawn (its own solids authored inline), a
  `DungeonFloorMap` room is an instance of an already-authored, fixed-size
  `RoomPiece` (picked from whatever's currently open in the "PvE Room Library"
  tab) dropped at a position, never resized. A new `validateDungeonFloorMap`
  (`validate.ts`) is the save-time gate, mirroring `validateArenaMap`: every
  `pieceId` resolves against the open library docs, no two rooms overlap, every
  door sits on a real shared room boundary, the door graph is reachable from
  `rooms[0]`, and `rooms[last]`'s piece has `role: 'extraction'` or `'boss'`.
- **Deliberate scope cuts, matching the branching pass's own precedent**: no
  in-editor encounter/wave authoring beyond what "PvE Room Library" mode
  already offers per-piece (a floor's wave schedule stays generated from each
  room's own authored `WaveScript`, same as today — this pass only changes
  which rooms/doors exist and where, never encounter timing); no mixed
  procedural-with-manual-override *within* one floor (a `floorMaps` entry
  replaces a floor's placement wholesale). No shipped biome uses `floorMaps`
  yet (`EMBER_DUNGEON` is untouched) — authoring one is a content task, not
  part of this pass, same as branching's own "no shipped content forks yet"
  note.

Verified live in the browser, not just unit tests (synthetic `PointerEvent`/`WheelEvent`
dispatch, since the sandboxed Browser pane can't composite Pixi frames for a real
screenshot — see the memory's documented workaround): mode switch, the piece picker,
placing two room instances with overlap rejection, dragging a room, connecting a real
door between two adjacent rooms (`tryConnectDoor` computed the exact expected
`passageGrid`), and the Save button's validation gate correctly blocking a
capstone-convention violation with the right message. No `ENGINE_VERSION` bump (no
shipped config sets `floorMaps`, and it changes nothing for one that doesn't).

**"全部加测试" follow-up, same day:** `DungeonFloorCanvas` — the single most complex new
file this pass (overlap-rejecting placement, the door tool's two-click state machine,
drag-move-with-revert, dangling-piece-reference rendering) — had zero dedicated tests,
matching `ArenaCanvas`/`RoomCanvas`'s own long-standing gap (their `mount()` needs a
real `Application.init()`/canvas, unavailable in plain vitest). Closed it instead of
extending the gap: confirmed empirically that this class's constructor never touches
`host`/`document`/`window` (every field — `app`, `camera`, `world`, `shapes`, `labels`,
`preview` — is a plain, renderer-free Pixi object) and that an unparented `Container`'s
`toLocal()` still applies its own `position` correctly with no render pass ever run —
so skipping `mount()` entirely leaves `toGrid(px,py)` reduced to the clean, predictable
`(px/GRID_PX, py/GRID_PX)`. New `DungeonFloorCanvas.test.ts` (28 tests) drives the real
private `onPointerDown`/`onPointerMove`/`onPointerUp`/`tryConnectDoor`/`roomAt`/`doorAt`/
`nextRoomId` methods directly (bracket-notation access, same convention
`Minimap.test.ts`/`HudView.test.ts` already use) and reads `redraw()`'s actual
`Graphics.context.instructions` output (fill vs. stroke, since every shape here draws
both — unlike `Minimap`'s fill-only rooms) for entrance/capstone tinting, dangling-piece
placeholders, door lines, and selection-stroke highlighting. Not covered, documented
in the file's own header rather than silently skipped: `onKeyDown`'s Delete path (needs
`document`/`HTMLInputElement`/`HTMLTextAreaElement`, not worth stubbing for one path),
and `onWheel`/pan/`fitView`'s exact camera math (cosmetic view-fitting, not authoring
correctness). 28 new map-editor tests (64, was 36) — 1623 total across all 7 workspaces,
`tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Level 1 is now fully hand-authored ✅ (2026-08-15)

Closes the previous subsection's own open end — "No shipped biome uses `floorMaps` yet
(`EMBER_DUNGEON` is untouched) — authoring one is a content task". That content task is
this one, for the whole level rather than a single floor. `ENGINE_VERSION` 38.

- **Shape: 5 floors, 5 / 6 / 7 / 6 / 5 rooms** (the capstone counts as one of them —
  29 rooms total). Floors 0-3 are capped by `ember_l1_extraction`, floor 4 by
  `ember_l1_boss`. A per-floor room count is something `roomsPerFloor`'s `{min, max}`
  range structurally cannot express, which is a large part of why the level is
  authored rather than drawn; the range left on `EMBER_DUNGEON` now describes only the
  procedural fallback a floor would take if its authored map were removed.
- **Room sizes 15x15 to 20x20 grid cells; enemy count ramps with cell count**, 8 at
  225 cells up to 14 at 400 (`enemyCountForArea`), so a bigger room is always the
  bigger fight. 285 enemies across the level. (This shipped at 15→30 / 581 enemies and
  was halved on 2026-08-17 — see "Room encounter budget" below for the measurements
  that forced it.) The extraction capstone is the one
  deliberate exception at 0 enemies: `DoorSystem`/`ExtractionSystem` both treat
  "capstone cleared" as the floor's gate, so garrisoning it would turn every
  checkpoint into a second boss fight.
- **`difficultyCurve` drops to `perFloor: 0.5`.** `curveAt` is a plain
  `base + perFloor * floorIndex` multiplier on enemy maxHp, so leaving it at 1 would
  have taken the deepest floor from x3 to x5 purely as a side effect of going 3 floors
  to 5. x0.5 keeps the same x3 ceiling over five floors instead of three.
- **The content is JSON under `world/dungeons/ember/`, not TypeScript** — 14
  `RoomPiece` files plus 5 `DungeonFloorMap` files, in exactly the two shapes
  `tools/map-editor` reads and writes, so the level is tuned in the editor rather than
  in a source literal. `engine/world/rooms/emberLevel1.ts` is a pure loader over them.
  PvP set that precedent first and has since moved the other way: its 60-room arena is
  hand-authored TypeScript (`engine/world/arenas/` `arena_launch`), because a map whose layout
  is a drawing reads better as code than as JSON — the JSON predecessor
  `world/arenas/arena_prototype_60.json` was retired and deleted 2026-08-26. This level stays
  JSON under `world/` so the editor can round-trip it: code only points at it. Seeded
  once by `tools/map-editor/scripts/genEmberLevel1.mjs`, deliberately not wired into
  any npm script — re-running it overwrites editor tweaks, and the JSON is the source
  of truth from the moment it lands.
- **Doors are validated for physical passability, not just declared adjacency.**
  `validateDungeonFloorMap` (the editor's save gate) already covers the structural
  half — no overlaps, doors on a real shared wall, reachability through the door
  GRAPH, capstone last — but a door can satisfy all of that and still be unwalkable:
  it can open onto an interior solid, or cut only one of the two abutting perimeter
  walls. So `engine/world/rooms/emberLevel1.test.ts` runs the real engine path
  (`placeAuthoredFloor` → `buildFloorGeometry`, the same two calls `SpawnSystem`
  makes), rasterises the resulting door-carved Fp wall list back onto the grid, and
  flood-fills from the spawn room — every room's `entranceGrid` and every authored
  spawn point has to come out reachable, and the fill has to physically enter every
  room. `tools/map-editor/src/emberLevel1Content.test.ts` is the matching authoring-side
  gate: the shipped files must pass the editor's OWN validators, or the first
  tweak-and-save would be blocked on a problem the content shipped with. The authoring
  rule that makes the geometry check pass is a 4-cell decor margin off every
  perimeter, so a door carved anywhere along a wall always opens onto clear floor.
- **The old procedural pair is kept, not deleted.** `EMBER_ROOMS` plus a new
  `EMBER_PROCEDURAL_DUNGEON` export (the exact descriptor `EMBER_DUNGEON` was before
  this change) is what `world/dungeon.test.ts`'s graph2d seed sweeps and exhaustive
  pool enumeration still drive — that coverage is the reason those seven pieces' exit
  topology is what it is (the "found NOT by inspection" paragraph above). Nothing in a
  shipped run reads the procedural pair now.
- **Open, deliberately left for editor tuning**: the floors are spanning trees (rooms
  connect in a chain, extra loop doors only appear where rooms happen to end up
  flush — none did on this pass), so no floor currently has an alternate route; enemy
  type mixes are per-piece rather than per-floor, so the same piece fights the same way
  wherever it appears; and every room still spawns its whole garrison at tick 0 (an
  absent `encounter` is the engine's hand-authored default, and it is what makes a room
  genuinely cleared the moment it is empty — a staggered script would let a player
  leave through a door that unlocked between waves).

### Room encounter budget ✅ (2026-08-17, `ENGINE_VERSION` 41)

The third and final round of one live report — *"一进游戏就被集火秒杀"* (I get focus-fired
down the moment I enter). `ENGINE_VERSION` 37 (mobs chase) and 40 (mobs only fire once
inside their own `engageRangeFp`) were both aimed at it and both diagnosed by reasoning
alone; each bought about half a second, because a room's garrison simply CLOSED to
engage range as one blob and opened up together.

**What settled it was building the measurement first.** `client/sim/pveLevelSim.sim.ts`
(`npm run test:pve-sim`) plays the shipped level with `PveBotController` at two skill
profiles and reports, per room: garrison size, reaction window (activation → first
damage taken), peak simultaneous shooters, damage taken, clear rate. On the shipped v40
build it read: **14 of 15 mobs firing on the same tick, first hit 0.6s after the room
woke, worst 1-second window 10 damage against a starter character's 9.2 effective HP,
and death in the entrance room in 100% of runs at both profiles.** No per-enemy number
can fix that shape — 15 mobs each firing a 1-damage shot every 1.5s is 10 damage/second
however reasonable each individual mob is.

So the budget is a property of the **room**, the same unit aggro already lives on:

- **`ROOM_FIRE_BUDGET` = 2** (`engine/balance/encounter.ts`). At most 2 mobs per room may
  have `firing` set on any tick, awarded to the NEAREST contenders; the rest hold
  position inside engage range and take a slot when a shooter dies or the player moves
  and reorders the queue. A room may hold a crowd; it may not alpha-strike.
- **Staggered wake-up** — `noticeDelayTicks(id)` = 18 + `id % 30` ticks (0.6-1.6s) after
  activation, during which a mob may move but not fire. Derived from the enemy id, not
  an `aiPrng` draw: reproducible with no new PRNG draw site and no new field to
  serialize. Per-enemy rather than flat, or the whole simultaneous volley would just
  arrive later.
- **Garrisons halved** — `enemyCountForArea` 15→30 becomes 8→14 (content, no version
  bump). This half is about CLEAR TIME, not incoming damage: the starter blaster does 5
  damage/second, so 15 mobs averaging 3.5 HP is ~11 seconds of uninterrupted shooting
  per room, 29 rooms deep.
- **Authored player-spawn clearance 3 → 6 grid.** `ember_l1_cell` put its nearest mob 3.2
  grid from the spawn point, i.e. inside the 5.6-grid engage range before the run began.
  A room that opens pre-aimed is something no engine-side pacing can undo.
- **`SHIELD_REGEN_INTERVAL` 300 → 60 ticks** (~10s → ~2s per +1). The shield was
  effectively single-use in a run: refilling 3.2 shield took ~32s of taking no damage,
  while a room takes ~8s to clear and the next is seconds away — so a player entered a
  37-enemy floor with one 9.2-point pool and no way to get any of it back except heal
  drops. This makes the two-pool split mean what "Survivability model" below says it
  means (shield renewable, HP permanent), and makes disengaging between rooms a real
  tactic. Re-checked against `npm run test:pvp-sim`: arena win rates moved within noise.

### Room feel pass ✅ (2026-08-17, `ENGINE_VERSION` 42)

A separate live report the same day, about how a room full of mobs *reads* rather than how
hard it hits: *"怪物之间要有碰撞。怪物的感知范围弄小一些，移动速度调低."* Three changes,
all in the PvE enemy path (full account in `engine/ENGINE_VERSION_HISTORY.md` v42):

- **Enemy↔enemy push-out re-enabled** (`MovementSystem.resolveActorPairs`). That pair was
  this engine's one documented faction exception, skipped on `07`'s own "Open questions"
  recommendation that packed rooms read better with mobs leaning overlap. In practice a
  garrison converging on the player stacked into a single blob of overlapping sprites, so
  the player could neither count the threat nor tell what they were shooting. There is no
  longer any faction branch in that loop.
- **Perception radius** — `DEFAULT_ENEMY_AGGRO_RANGE_FP` = 320 px (10 grid),
  `AIDecideSystem.hasAggro`. Room activation stays the OUTER aggro gate and is unchanged;
  this is a new inner one. Opening a door used to set the room's whole garrison walking at
  the player from wherever it was authored, so a room read as one converging blob instead
  of a space with pockets of threat in it. An un-noticed mob is fully inert — no movement,
  no fire, and no turning to face. Wider than the 180 px engage range, so a mob that
  notices the player still has ~4 grid to close before it may fire and v40's reaction
  window survives. `EnemyActor.aggroed` latches one-way, like `enraged`: the radius is a
  wake-up trigger, never a leash, and a boundary-straddling mob can't oscillate.
- **Enemy move speed 4 → 2.6 px/tick** (~63% → ~41% of the player's). v37's claim that a
  slower mob means "committing to running away always opens the gap" didn't survive
  contact — the player also has to aim and dodge.

**This made level 1 substantially easier and the sim says so:** the careful bot's average
deepest floor went 0.1 → 1.9 and its worst 1-second damage window 5 → 4 against the same
9.2 effective HP. The `test:pve-sim` gates below still pass, but the "hard overall" target
they encode is now met with much more headroom — a garrison re-tightening pass is open
work, and `ROOM_FIRE_BUDGET` / garrison size are where it should happen, not by undoing
the perception radius.

*Two sim-bot fixes shipped alongside, both the same bug class and neither an engine
change:* `PveBotController.nearestEnemy` and `healToSeek` are now bounded by the bot's own
room rather than by a scan radius. A room's doors are combat-locked while it holds a live
enemy, so a mob or a heal outside the room is unreachable, and with mobs no longer walking
over on their own the bot found no target, fell through to `travel`, and bounced off the
locked door until the run timed out. That is the sim's no-stall gate doing its job.

**Difficulty target, chosen 2026-08-17: hard overall.** Floor 1 passable by careful play,
a full 5-floor extraction uncommon. After the changes the sim's careful bot clears the
entrance room in 100% of runs, descends off floor 0 in ~37%, and dies spread across
floors 0-3; the aggressive profile (walks into the mob's face, never rests) dies on floor
0. Both directions are gated in the sim so a later tuning pass can fail for being too
lethal *or* for overshooting into a walkover. Read the bot as a LOWER bound on a human —
it never swaps to the saber (2 damage, hits everything in the arc, parries bullets) and
never dodges a shot on purpose.

**A second, worse bug fell out of the same sim run: a real softlock.** The tick a player's
step across a threshold activates a room, their body is still in the doorway;
`EnvironmentSystem` had already re-tagged `p.roomId`, so `DoorSystem.forceRegroup`'s
"skip whoever is already inside" test skipped them, and then the restored passage wall
pushed them out — often back the way they came. The room stays in combat behind a
permanently locked door, the floor can never be cleared, and the run can only end in
death. Fixed by `inLockingDoorway`: a player physically overlapping a passage that is
about to lock gets pulled onto the room's entrance like everyone else, which is what "the
door locks you in the fight" was always meant to mean. It wedged 7 of 8 bot runs before
the fix; the sim's no-stall gate is its regression check.

## Survivability model (HP + shield)

Every actor has **two defensive pools**; the character (skin, `02`) contributes *only* these plus one break-passive — all offensive depth is the weapon.

- **HP is the hard floor.** When HP hits 0 the actor dies (co-op: downed, revivable). HP is **recovered only by items** — a healing pickup restores a **flat +1 HP**, dropped by chests and AI enemies (`07`/`09`).
- **Shield is the soft buffer, taken first.** All incoming damage — including elemental DoT (`07`) — depletes shield before it touches HP.
- **Shield auto-regenerates; HP never does.** After **3 s without being hit**, shield trickles back at **1 point / 10 s**. *Any* hit — including a burn/poison DoT tick — resets the 3 s timer, so clearing a lingering status (kiting, an item) is a precondition for regen. Shield is a between-fights recovery, not a mid-fight heal.
- **Breaking a shield can fire a character passive.** The instant a shield is depleted, the character's bound break-passive (e.g. an AoE burst / knockback on nearby enemies) triggers — this is the concrete form of `02`'s "skin may carry a minor passive." A 0-shield character simply never triggers one.
- **Characters differ only by `(maxHp, maxShield)` + that break-passive.** They are *not* balanced to equal effective HP: a plain starter might be **8 HP / 0 shield** (no regen buffer, no break-passive — pure item-dependence), a skirmisher **3 HP / 10 shield** (huge regenerating buffer, but fragile the instant burst punches through). The engine bodies (absorb order, regen timer, break event) live in `07`/`08`; the numbers live in `@dd/engine` config (`09`).

## Pickup rules

Three pickup classes, split by **whether the player must make a choice**. Materials and consumables are pure upside → automatic; weapons are a trade-off → click-driven. All pickup/effect logic runs **inside the sim tick off deterministic state** (`06`/`08`) — identical on every client; only the weapon-pickup panel's rendering is render-only (the click itself is a real command, see below).

- **Materials — auto, into the floor buffer.** Walking within a material's pickup radius auto-collects it into **this floor's un-banked buffer** (a temporary bag). There is no save action to bank it — banking is the **extraction-room checkpoint**: when you **DESCEND or EXTRACT**, the floor buffer merges into the run's carry-out bag (the only thing that leaves a run, above). The carry-out only becomes *account* materials on a successful **EXTRACT**; a run-ending death or team wipe forfeits the **whole un-extracted carry-out** (this floor's buffer plus everything descended-but-not-extracted this run) — that at-risk pile is exactly the "bank now or dive deeper" stake (see the co-op wipe decision in Open questions). The persistent account stash is never at risk. ✅ **Shipped 2026-07-24 (ROADMAP 1.4/1.5, `ENGINE_VERSION` 15, additive):** `PickupSystem` sums a collected material's qty into `state.floorMaterials`; `ExtractionSystem` (new step 12) merges it into `state.bankedMaterials` on either resolution and resets the buffer — a run-ending death simply never reaches that merge, which **is** the forfeit rule, no extra code needed. The EXTRACT/DESCEND choice itself: reaching the per-floor checkpoint (this floor's waves exhausted, no enemies left) opens a window where a **sustained INTERACT hold** (~1 s, mirrors the revive-channel's held-vs-tapped precedent) resolves EXTRACT, and a **tap** (hold released early) resolves DESCEND — first-pass input mapping, `10`'s UI/HUD work may refine the actual button feel. The last floor has no descend option, but still needs the same explicit EXTRACT press as every other floor before the run ends — it does NOT auto-resolve the instant the boss dies (dropped 2026-08-12: an instant, no-gesture resolution ended the run the same tick the boss died, before the player could ever walk over to its own death drops). *Runs today on the demo's single arena/wave-list, not yet a distinct `RoomPiece` per floor — see `09`'s dungeon-assembly note.*
- **Consumables — auto-apply, but only when useful.** An instant item (healing pickup = flat **+1 HP**, `07`/`09`) is consumed on contact, no inventory. To avoid overheal waste with **no item bag**, the pickup radius only triggers **when the effect would actually do something** — at full HP the health pickup is left on the floor for you to grab later. Same rule generalizes to any future instant item (shield/temp buff): auto-grab only if it changes state.
- **Weapons — click-driven, drop-on-replace.** Not auto (swapping is a choice). A non-blocking **weapon-pickup panel** (`10`, ENGINE_VERSION 32) lists every floor weapon within reach (real icon + name); tapping a row IS the pickup — no modal, no pause, lockstep can't stop for one player. `PickupSystem` swaps it into the active slot and **the replaced weapon drops back onto the floor** (`02`/`03`). The switch button picks which of the two slots to overwrite. (Superseded the original single-nearest "ground compare card" + tap-`INTERACT` gesture — see `03`'s "Pickup & switch" section for the full history.)

## PvP (PvPvE arena) — battle royale

**(DECIDED, ROADMAP Phase 4.1 — full schema in `15-pvp-arena.md`.)** PvP is a **last-player-standing (or last-SQUAD-standing) battle royale with a shrinking safe zone**, not a symmetric team arena. This revises the "3v3/4v4" framing below to an 8-player mode first.

- **8-player, squad or solo, elimination + shrinking zone.** ✅ **Shipped (design/05/15's squad follow-up, `ENGINE_VERSION` 30):** an 8-seat match is 2 squads of 4 (`SQUAD_SIZE` in `client/src/game/match/pvpConfig.ts`) whenever `playerCount` divides evenly into at least 2 squads — any other seat count (including exactly 4) stays the original one-`teamId`-per-seat free-for-all, since a single squad covering every seat would leave nobody able to fight anybody. A squad forms by **pre-formed party invite** (a short join code, `server/src/PartyService.ts` + the client SQUAD lobby screen — not auto-grouped solo queue, not a real friends list) or, absent a party, matchmaking places solo queuers into a squad of strangers transparently. `Matchmaker.ts`'s seat assignment and `buildPvpEngineConfig`'s independent per-seat derivation both compute `teamId` from the exact same pure `teamIdForOwner(owner, playerCount)` formula, so a seat's squad is never in question regardless of who — real player, party member, or bot — ends up in it.
- **Win condition: placement, not a binary win/lose.** The run tracks **elimination order** (8th → 1st), not just "did you win." `WinConditionSystem`'s `Winner` vocabulary needs a per-seat placement, not just `'enemies' | number` (`15`).
- **PvPvE: the threat is rival players *and* AI.** The arena AI is **the same enemy blueprints as the PvE dungeon** (`09` `ENEMY_BLUEPRINTS`), reused as-is — not a separate PvP-only roster. It is deliberately **both a hazard and a farm**: it can kill you, and killing it drops loot, so clearing a room of AI is a real risk/reward choice against the clock of the shrinking zone and the chance a rival player is doing the same math. It is hostile to every player seat, never neutral (`15`).
- **Gear: same drop model as PvE, but the arena's own table — not a fixed preset loadout.** This revises the "unified presets" framing below. Players start from a small **landing kit** (opening weapon(s), a preset — the honest predecessor of this section's original plan), but the moment-to-moment power curve comes from **looting the arena** exactly like a PvE floor: weapon/buff/heal pickups drop from AI kills and room loot, rolled from an arena-scoped `DropTable` (`09`/`15`). The fairness wall is unchanged and still structural: `buildArenaSpecs` takes **no** weapon/material/blueprint parameter (`09`/`14`) — the arena's loot pool is its own self-contained content, with zero connection to a player's account, blueprints, or PvE materials. A landing-kit-only model (no arena loot) was considered and rejected: it keeps the fairness math simplest but throws away the entire point of a large, room-based map — there would be nothing to explore for.
- **The zone (shrinking safe area) drives elimination pacing.** Full model — room-graph adjacency, stage timing, damage curve, the `EnvironmentSystem` that applies it — lives in `15-pvp-arena.md`. In short: rooms (not a geometric circle) are the unit of "safe," a fixed **eye room** is drawn per-match from a map-authored candidate pool, and the safe set shrinks in BFS-distance rings from it, so the safe area is always connected and the shrink is always monotonic (no player is ever sealed into a dead pocket).
- **HP and weapon numbers are uniformly scaled up for PvP.** The PvE survivability model (2–10-ish HP/shield, `07`'s +1 heal item) doesn't hold at battle-royale pacing. PvP applies a single scale factor to **both** a character's `(maxHp, maxShield)` and weapon damage/handling at `buildArenaSpecs` time, so relative time-to-kill matches PvE's feel — just at a bigger number range that has room for a shrinking-zone DoT curve to matter (`15`). This is a second, PvP-only tuning pass on top of the same `SkinDef`/`WeaponSpec` content — not a second content set.
- **Landing is system-assigned; there is no drop-in/parachute choice.** The map author (via a **dedicated map editor**, not this doc) pre-places spawn points; the engine deals seats to spawns via `ringPrng` at match start. No UI for picking a landing spot.
- **Downed/revive differs from PvE in two ways, both shipped.** PvE's revive (`05` above — free channel, unlimited, bleedout-gated) does **not** carry over as-is. ✅ **Shipped:** PvP revive is **gated by a consumable bandage item** (`{kind:'bandage'}`, an arena-only drop) instead of a free channel — `ReviveSystem` requires the reviver to be on the downed player's own `teamId` (never a rival squad) AND holding at least one bandage, spent only on a **completed** revive, never an interrupted one. And downed players are **not** invulnerable in PvP the way they are in PvE — `targeting.ts`'s `hostileTargets` drops the downed-exclusion whenever `state.zoneEnabled`. In a solo (singleton-squad) match neither rule is reachable in practice — there is no teammate to revive — so solo play is unaffected.
- **No PvP materials — a separate ladder rating instead.** PvP kills/placements do **not** feed the PvE material economy (`09`'s "affects PvP? No — normalized out" now reads both directions: materials don't reach PvP, and PvP doesn't produce materials either). Instead, PvP awards an account-level **ladder rating**, computed and stored **server-side** (the matchmaking control plane, not `@dd/engine` state — it must never enter the replay/state hash), from **verified** match results only (`06`'s anti-cheat backstop gates what counts). This keeps PvE's "materials are the only carry-out" rule intact and gives PvP its own, structurally separate progression.
- **Map: one hand-authored ~60-room arena to start, produced by a dedicated map editor.** ✅ Shipped 2026-08-25 as `arena_launch` ("The Seven Districts", `engine/world/arenas/`) — see `15`. Not a procedural layout (`15`'s `ArenaMap` is closer to `09`'s hand-authored `RoomPiece` library than to the seeded `generateFloor` dungeon assembly) — room layout, doors, monster placement, loot markers, and per-cell hazard traits (spikes, freeze, etc.) are all editor-authored content, not engine-generated. The engine only consumes the produced `ArenaMap` data (`15`).
- Accepted trade-off, **now stronger than before**: a player's meta collection (blueprints, materials) still does not show up in PvP — but characters remain the one exception, unchanged (`14`).

## Economy (summary)

| Axis | Source | Persists past a run? | Affects PvP? |
|------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Materials** | banked during a PvE run (deeper floors → better) | **Yes** — the only carry-out; the meta-forge currency | **No** — normalized out |
| **In-run weapons / buffs** | found this run (chests, drops) | **No** — every weapon is wiped at run end | N/A (PvE only) |
| **Brought-in weapon(s)** | crafted per-run from an unlocked blueprint + materials, equipped into the loadout (0–2); a free slot is filled with the starter weapon of the kind the loadout does not already cover, so a run always spawns carrying one gun and one melee weapon and the SWAP verb always has a second slot (`resolveLoadout`, ENGINE_VERSION 45); the crafted instance = one run (`14`) | **No** *within a run* (wiped like any weapon); the blueprint unlock is permanent/account-level (`14`) | N/A (PvE only) |
| **Character (skin)** | free roster + purchased; carries `(maxHp,maxShield)` + break-passive (`14`) | **Yes** — account-level | **Yes** — the *one* meta thing in PvP, but side-grades only (no all-rounder), fairness by balance discipline (`14`) |
| **Arena preset / in-match pickups** | preset chosen at match start / dropped on map | No | Yes — the only PvP power source |

The split that keeps PvP fair: **crafted weapons never reach PvP** (the preset wall, structural — `09`), and the **one** meta axis that does reach PvP is *character choice*, held fair by side-grade balance discipline (`14`). All balance numbers live in `@dd/engine` config (`06` "numbers live in one place"); this doc only names the shape. The forging / blueprint / crafting-cost / monetization mechanics are locked in the **meta doc** (`14`).

## Parry (block/deflect) positioning

The pivot mechanic from `03`. Its identity across the game:

- **Melee-only, and it lives inside the swing.** There is no `isBlocking`/`blockArc` and no block button: a melee swing's sector (arc + range) deflects any enemy bullet caught in it — flipping faction and redirecting it (`03`). Ranged loadouts have no parry — the core ranged-vs-melee trade-off.
- **In PvE:** parry is a skill-expression tool against bullet-hell enemies/bosses — swing through the incoming pattern to bat it back. High skill ceiling, optional (ranged builds route around it with mobility/DPS).
- **In PvP:** deflecting an opponent's bullets back is powerful, but it is **already a commitment, not a free toggle** — parrying costs you a swing (its arc window, its cooldown, and facing the threat), and the melee-only restriction bounds it to players who gave up ranged pressure. Further costs (perfect-swing window, extra recovery) are engine-config balance, decided against real play.

## Controls & orientation

- **Landscape only.** Dropped portrait (see locked decisions).
- **Movement-only controls** (`04`, `10` v33): a single stick moves; a fire button/left-click **fires the active weapon** — there is no separate aim input at all. The engine auto-faces the nearest hostile if one exists, else the movement direction, else it holds the last facing (`08`'s `ApplyInputSystem`) — a fired shot and a melee swing's hit-arc both travel along this facing, exactly like an enemy's own AI-computed facing. A corner **switch button** toggles which of the two weapon slots is active (`SWAP_WEAPON`, `08`), and an `INTERACT` button opens chests / revives a downed teammate. Switching to an empty slot leaves you unable to fire until you switch back or pick a weapon into it. There is no block or jump button — parry is the melee swing, so *timing the attack* is the deliberate act. (A future dodge, if added, will be a planar blink, not a jump.) (An earlier manual-aim scheme — before that, a briefly-shipped auto-aim-to-nearest override — both preceded this; see `10`'s aim history note.)

## Relationship to the other docs

- **Weapons** (`03`): the loop's moment-to-moment depth is weapon variety + parry; this doc says *when/where* you acquire and swap them (drops in PvE, normalized loadout in PvP).
- **Entity model** (`02`): a character carries **only** `(maxHp, maxShield)` + a shield-break passive; all offensive depth is the weapon — so a run's power comes from the weapon + run-buffs, not the character. Weapon-slot rules (2 slots, pickup-replaces-active-slot, pistol backup) live in `02`.
- **Netcode** (`06`): modes, the ephemeral-in-run split, casual-first, and determinism constraints all originate there; this doc must not contradict it. The adopted PvE extraction form is specifically shaped to stay inside `06`'s casual-first and to add no open-world player-state netcode.

## To design

- **Difficulty / material curve** across the ~5 floors (biomes? how enemy tier and material quality escalate with depth). Floor count and rooms-per-floor (5–10) are tentative and need play-tuning.
- **Reward-choice structure** within/between floors (branching paths, shop, curse/blessing), and where the extraction room sits per floor (it gates how many rooms are skippable).
- **Materials → forging**: the material tiers and what forging produces are **locked in the meta doc** (`14`: blueprint unlock + per-run material craft, five elemental material kinds, intrinsic weapon rarity). Remaining there is recipe/blueprint/run-buff content tuning.
- **Character roster & `(maxHp, maxShield)` + break-passive set**: the actual defensive stat pairs and break-passives (`02`/`09`/`14`), which are free vs paid, and the side-grade balance-test suite (`14`). (Every skin is a character with stats — there is no cosmetic-only skin, `14`.)
- **Healing-item drop rate / cap** (flat +1 HP): how common, any stack limit.
- The PvP **landing-kit set** (how many, contents — a small opener, not a full loadout), the arena's own loot/drop table, and the PvP HP/damage scale factor's exact value — all content-tuning work against real play, not blocking (`15`). Squad revive's bandage drop weight (currently 5/100 on the arena table) is likewise a first-pass placeholder, same as every other arena drop weight.

## Open questions

- ~~**Co-op revive & team-wipe**~~ **(DECIDED + shipped, ROADMAP 3.2, `ENGINE_VERSION` 16→17):** the model, resolving the three sub-questions:
  - **How many revives?** *Unlimited* — there is no per-run or per-player revive counter. A lethal hit sends a player **`downed`** (not dead) with a **bleedout timer** (`DOWNED_BLEEDOUT_TICKS`, ~30 s); the natural limiter is that timer plus the long channel plus the reviver's exposure, not a hard cap. This keeps the rule stateless and replay-clean, and avoids a "last-revive" cliff that punishes the group that keeps trying.
  - **Is the downed player vulnerable?** *No — a downed player is invulnerable to further damage* (they are already at 0 HP; bullets/AoE/DoT skip them). Only two things end a downed player: the **bleedout timer expiring** (→ permanently `dead`, unrevivable) or a **total team wipe**. The revive channel **pauses bleedout while it is actively running**, so a committed, uninterrupted revive always succeeds — the tension is *reaching* the teammate and *staying* on the channel (it cancels/resets if the reviver moves out of range, stops holding INTERACT, or is themselves downed), not racing a clock the rescuer can't see.
  - **What ends a run on a total wipe?** The run ends (enemies win) **the moment no player is "up"** — i.e. every player is simultaneously `downed`-or-`dead`, so no one remains to revive. A wipe forfeits the **entire un-extracted run carry-out** (this floor's buffer *and* everything banked-this-run since the last extraction), *not* just the current floor — this is what preserves the core "bank now [EXTRACT] or dive deeper [risk it all]" push-your-luck tension (line 21). The **account stash is never touched by a run**, so nothing *persistent* is ever lost (line 21's promise); only the current run's winnings are at stake. *(This supersedes the looser "lose only that floor's un-banked buffer" phrasing at line 70, which understated the risk and contradicted the push-your-luck pillar.)*
  - In **single-player** this all collapses correctly with zero special-casing: the sole player going `downed` means "no player up" → the run ends that same tick (no teammate can ever revive), exactly the old death behaviour — the bleedout/revive machinery is simply inert without a second player.
- Is co-op PvE **matchmade** or **friends/party only** at launch? (Affects `06` room/relay transport.)
- ~~**Descend vs extract UI/commitment**~~ **(first-pass shipped, ROADMAP 1.4):** forward-only, as assumed — descending reloads the next floor's waves, no backtrack. The input mapping (hold=extract, tap=descend) is a first-pass engine-side convention, not a final UI decision; `10`'s HUD work may change the actual control feel (e.g. an explicit two-choice prompt instead of a hold gesture).
- ~~PvPvE arena AI: neutral hazard, contested objective, or material farm — and symmetric spawns only, or contested map objectives?~~ **(DECIDED, ROADMAP 4.1):** hazard **and** farm, hostile to every seat, reusing PvE's exact `ENEMY_BLUEPRINTS` — not neutral, not objective-gated. Spawns are system-assigned per-seat from an editor-authored point pool, not player-chosen; no contested map objective beyond the shrinking zone itself (`15`).
- Parry vs PvP balance: does deflected player-damage get scaled down to avoid one-shot swings? Decide against real matches — now sits inside the broader PvP HP/weapon scale-factor tuning pass (`15`).
- ~~Meta "horizontal" boundary~~ **(resolved, `14`):** meta no longer grants a stat ladder at all. Crafted weapons never reach PvP (structural wall); the only meta axis in PvP is *which character* you picked, and characters are side-grades (no all-rounder), enforced by balance discipline + tests. PvE weapon power comes from intrinsic rarity (a small edge + better handling, never crushing) — not a horizontal-delta cap.
- ~~**Shield-break passive in PvP**~~ **(resolved, `14`):** characters *do* enter PvP, so the break-passive **survives** — but the whole character (HP/shield + passive) must be balanced as a side-grade. Answered together with `09`'s skin-passive question.
