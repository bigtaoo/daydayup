# Collision & combat

The bodies of the simulation's hit-detection and damage steps. `08-simulation-core.md` locks the `step()` **order and interfaces** — this doc fills in the *what happens* for steps 4–9 (movement/collision, projectile flight, deflect, hit resolution, death & drops). All math obeys `06-netcode-determinism.md`: fixed-point (`Fp`), integer brad angles, `isqrt` (never `Math.sqrt`), injected `Prng` (never `Math.random`). It realizes the swing-based deflect mechanic from `03-weapon-system.md` and the run economy (drops) from `05-gameplay.md`.

> **funny mapping.** funny (`C:\Users\TaoWang\Documents\funny/server/engine/src/`) is a *lane* game: units advance along grid columns and its "collision" is one-dimensional gap arithmetic; its projectiles **home on a target id**; it has **no trig at all**. DayDayUp is free-2D with directional bullets and angular arcs, so collision and ballistics **diverge heavily** — flagged **⟂ diverges** below. What *does* port cleanly is funny's damage discipline: circle radii + `isqrt` distance, flat-armor `takeDamage`, a frozen hit payload, one shared hit-resolver, and two-phase death.

## The decisions (locked)

- **Actors are circles; solids are static.** Every `Actor` has `radius_fp` (funny's `radius_fp`) for bullet/melee hits, plus a smaller `footprintRadius_fp` (the feet) used against other ACTORS — so two tall sprites may visually overlap in a crowd where their feet don't — plus `solidRadius_fp`, the radius used against static solids (walls and pillars), plus — for an enemy that has stopped moving — `standoffRadius` (v55, step 4.4 below), which is not a collision radius at all but how much personal space a STANDING mob keeps from other standing mobs. **The two overlaps are judged differently on purpose** (`ENGINE_VERSION` 43, 2026-08-19, live report *"角色走到墙角的时候，太靠墙了，感觉陷进去了"*): a body overlapping another body reads as a crowd, while a body overlapping stone reads as a body sunk INTO the stone. A character's `solidRadius_fp` is therefore its full body radius (16 px — the rendered body is exactly `radius` × 2 wide, `12`'s rig normalization), which lands its silhouette tangent to a wall it hugs; enemies keep the feet circle against solids too, so no mob path changes. The fake-3D depth cue the small footprint was originally for survives regardless on a wall's north/south sides, because the body floats 4–36 px above its own ground point (`13`'s "it floats, there is no walk cycle") and still overlaps most of a standing wall face at that clearance. Overlap = centre distance `< r₁+r₂`, distance via `isqrt(dx²+dy²)`. **Round pillar solids are implemented** (centre-line push-out by penetration depth, isqrt). **AABB tile/wall solids are implemented** (ROADMAP 1.2, 2026-07-24, additive/no `ENGINE_VERSION` bump — see `09`): circle-vs-rect closest-point push for an actor approaching from outside, axis-separation to the nearest edge when the clearance circle's centre is inside the rect; bullets stop/expire on overlap, same treatment as a pillar. `state.walls: AABB[]` sources from `EngineConfig.walls` today — a placed `RoomPiece`'s `solids` (1.3) will populate it the same way via `content/rooms.ts roomGeometry`. Full per-polygon physics is out of scope — this is a shooter, not a physics sandbox.
- **Deterministic uniform-grid broad phase.** ⟂ diverges. A fixed-cell-size spatial hash (cell = a small power-of-two multiple of a grid unit) buckets actors/bullets by `gx/gy`; narrow-phase only tests same/adjacent cells. Iteration is by **ascending entity id within ascending cell index**, never by `Map`/`Set` order (`06` ban). funny needs none of this (its lane grid *is* the index); we build it.
- **Bullets are directional and swept.** ⟂ diverges. A bullet carries a fp velocity from `cos_fp(brad)/sin_fp(brad)` (`03` ballistics), not a homing target. Because a fast bullet can cross an actor's diameter in one tick, collision is a **swept segment test** (this-tick start→end segment vs actor circle / vs wall), not a point-in-circle test at the endpoint — otherwise fast bullets tunnel through targets.
- **Angular arcs live in brad space via `06`'s fp-trig.** ⟂ diverges — **this doc is the first consumer of the fp-trig/brad module `06` calls the biggest new determinism surface.** A melee swing arc is a "distance < range AND |angleDiff(toTarget, facing)| < half" test (integer brad, never radians); the SAME arc both damages enemies and deflects bullets — there is no separate `blockArc`.
- **One frozen payload, one shared resolver.** Damage (and any crit roll from `combatPrng`) is snapshotted at *fire/swing* time into a payload and applied by a single `resolveHit(payload, target)` — identical for a bullet impact and a melee connect (funny's `ProjectilePayload` + `resolveAttackHit`). A bullet that outlives its firer still lands the frozen damage.
- **Flat-armor damage, integer HP.** `takeDamage(raw) → effective = armor>0 ? max(1, raw−armor) : raw` (funny verbatim). HP is an integer; no fractional health.
- **Two-pool health: shield absorbs before HP (`05`).** ✅ **Shipped** (ROADMAP 0.4, `ENGINE_VERSION` 11→12): a shared `takeDamage` (`systems/combat.ts`) does the shield-first absorb for direct hits, chains, and DoT; regen lives in the step-8 status pass; `shield_break` fires the character passive (0.5). ⟂ diverges — funny has HP only. Every actor carries `shield`/`maxShield` alongside `hp`/`maxHp`. **`hp` is an integer; `shield` is not required to be** — this bullet claimed both were until 2026-09-03, and shipped content had already broken it: the vanguard's `maxShield` is **3.2**, chosen deliberately so no two characters share an `(hp + shield)` budget (an exact tie empirically spikes simultaneous-elimination in `pvpBalanceSim` — see `content/skins.ts`'s own note). It is safe because every operation on the pool is `+`/`-` of an integer against it (regen adds 1 and clamps to `maxShield`; absorb subtracts post-resist integer damage), all of which are exact in IEEE-754 and therefore deterministic across clients — `replay.ts` hashes `shield` directly. It is NOT free: a fractional pool is what puts `hpTotal: 3.4000000000000004` in the golden witness, and the first `*` or `/` introduced on this field would put platform-dependent rounding straight into the state hash. Keep the arithmetic additive, or convert the pool to fp first. *All* post-armor, post-resist damage — direct hits **and** elemental DoT — depletes `shield` first; only the remainder spills into `hp`. `hp<=0` is death; `shield<=0` is not. **HP never auto-regenerates** — it is restored only by a healing pickup (flat `+1`, `05`/`09`). **Shield auto-regenerates** on an idle timer (below). The **instant** a hit reduces shield from `>0` to `0`, emit `shield_break` — a bound character passive (AoE / knockback, `02`) may fire off it. Characters differ only by `(maxHp, maxShield)` + that passive; they are not equalized to matching effective HP (`05`).
- **Shield regen is an idle timer, not a heal.** Each actor tracks `ticksSinceHit`, reset to 0 by *any* damage application (direct hit **or** a DoT tick). While `ticksSinceHit ≥ SHIELD_REGEN_DELAY` (~3 s), shield refills `+1` every `SHIELD_REGEN_INTERVAL` (~2 s), capped at `maxShield`. *(The interval was ~10 s through `ENGINE_VERSION` 40, which made the shield pool effectively single-use across a PvE run — see `05` "Room encounter budget".)* Because a burn/poison tick resets the timer (`08` step 8), clearing a lingering status is a precondition for regen. All tick counts are whole ticks from `@dd/engine` config (`09`), so it stays deterministic.
- **Invulnerability frames.** ⟂ diverges. After taking a hit an actor gets `invulnTicks` of i-frames (tick-counted, decremented each step); hits on an i-framed actor are ignored. Bullet-hell needs this; funny (no dodging) has none. Counts in whole ticks so it's deterministic.
- **No height / no jump.** Collision is strictly 2D on the ground plane — there is no `z`/`vz`/gravity on actors and no jump. (An earlier z-band "shoot over cover / jump over hazard" model was dropped: the logic-layer height complexity wasn't worth it. A future dodge is a planar blink, not a hop.) `z` survives only as a cosmetic bullet muzzle-height for the fake-3D render, never gating a hit.
- **Two-phase death.** A lethal hit sets `hp=0` / `dead=true` and emits `death`; a **sweep at the end of the combat step** removes dead actors and rolls drops. Never splice a live array mid-iteration (funny's mark-then-sweep).
- **Hostility, not faction, gates every interaction** (updated 2026-09-03 — this bullet described the pre-PvP world and had said "faction gates every interaction" since it was written). `faction ∈ {player, enemy}` still says which SIDE an actor is on, but the predicate every system actually calls is `isHostile(a, b)` (`state/entities.ts`), which compares `teamId`: two players are hostile iff their `teamId`s differ, and AI holds a reserved `ENEMY_TEAM_ID` hostile to every player team (`02`, `15`, `ENGINE_VERSION` 18). That is what makes player-vs-player fire and parrying a rival's bullet possible at all; PvE is simply the case where every player shares one `teamId`, so **no friendly fire** holds there for free rather than by a special case. The shared `hostileTargets`/`nearestHostile` helpers (`systems/targeting.ts`) are the only sanctioned way to enumerate the other side — none of the ~14 original `faction === 'player' ? enemies : players` ternaries survives. Deflect *flips* a bullet's faction **and its `teamId`** (`03`), so a parried shot answers to the same predicate.

## Coordinates and what "a hit" means

Collision resolves entirely in the **2D ground plane** (`gx/gy`, per `01-rendering.md`). There is **no height gating**: a hit is a ground-plane circle overlap, full stop.

`z` is not a gameplay dimension. Actors have no `z`/`vz` (jump removed). A bullet still carries a small `z` (muzzle height) but it is **purely cosmetic** — the fake-3D render lifts the sprite by it; no system reads it to decide a hit. The earlier "z-band gates overlap → jump over hazards / shoot over low cover" idea was dropped as too much logic-layer complexity for this shooter; if verticality is wanted later it comes back as its own explicit feature, not a field silently threaded through every hit test.

## Step 4 — movement & solid collision

Per moving actor (players + enemies), in ascending-id order:

1. Integrate velocity on the 2D plane: `gx += vx`, `gy += vy` (per-tick displacement is pre-baked, so it's a plain `addFp`, no dt multiply). No z / gravity — movement is planar.
2. **Actor–solid:** push the actor's `solidRadius` circle (v43; `footprintRadius` before that, and still what actor–actor uses) out of each overlapping static solid. For a **round pillar** (implemented): if centre distance `< solidRadius + pillarRadius`, shift the actor out along the centre line by the penetration depth (`isqrt` for the distance; a concentric overlap nudges a fixed +x for determinism). **AABB tile walls are also implemented** (ROADMAP 1.2, circle-vs-rect closest-point push / axis-separation when fully engulfed — see this doc's own decision above).
3. **Actor–actor:** ✅ **shipped** (`ENGINE_VERSION` 21→22) — for each overlapping same-plane pair among ALL alive actors (players and enemies alike, an all-pairs scan — a room/arena's live actor count is small enough that this costs nothing, same precedent as the static-solid resolvers), push both apart along the centre line by half the penetration each (`MovementSystem.resolveActorPairs`) — gap math mirrors funny's `subFp(subFp(other − rOther), (self + rSelf))`. Resolved in a **fixed ascending-id-ordered sequence** (never array-concatenation order) so the result is deterministic.
4. **Standing spacing:** ✅ **shipped** (`ENGINE_VERSION` 55, 2026-09-03, live report *"怪物寻路时要加一个停留体积，最好是两倍于怪物的体型，这样怪物才会分散"*) — the pair push above is a COLLISION rule, so it only fires once two feet circles already overlap, and a garrison that all stops at the same `engageRangeFp` ring parks 14 px apart with 30 px bodies: one silhouette, several health bars. So a mob that has ARRIVED (`EnemyActor.holding`, written by `AIDecideSystem`) also claims `standoffRadius` = 2 × its body `radius` of personal space, and `MovementSystem.resolveStandingSpacing` drifts two holding mobs apart to the sum of theirs — four body radii between centres. **Only between two mobs that are both holding**, which is the point rather than a detail: a mob that is still travelling neither exerts nor receives it, so a gap only 1.5 bodies wide is still walked through at full speed with a mob standing at its mouth, and clearance/routing are untouched (`solidRadius`, unchanged). It is a preference layered on the constraints, not a fourth constraint — applied after the collision push and before the solid re-separation, so stone always overrules it; capped per ACTOR per tick at that mob's own `moveSpeedPerTick`, so a crowd unpacks over ~half a second rather than exploding; and accumulated-then-applied, so the outcome does not depend on pair-visit order. It also makes "in engage range" hysteretic (`HOLD_RELEASE_PERMILLE`, 1.5×), because the push moves a standing mob outward and a bare threshold would have it re-chase, be pushed out and re-chase forever. Measured balance cost (`test:pve-sim`, 24 seeds): the careful bot's average floor reached 2.5 → 1.5 — the volley is not heavier, the player kills a spread arc more slowly. See `ENGINE_VERSION_HISTORY.md` v55.

Knockback (✅ shipped, `ENGINE_VERSION` 25, see "To design" below for the full account) is an impulse added into a dedicated `knockVx/knockVy` channel (in brad direction) by the hit step; this integrator adds it into the same tick's displacement as `vx/vy` and decays it by a fixed friction factor every tick — not `vx/vy` itself, which is fully re-derived from input/AI every tick and can't carry a persistent impulse.

## Step 5 — projectile flight & wall collision

Advance every bullet in `state.projectiles` (push order = fire order):

- New position = old + `velocity·dt`. Record the **swept segment** old→new.
- Test the segment against `RoomState` solids; first wall intersection → bullet stops/expires (emit `bullet_expired`) unless the weapon spec says it bounces (`03` ballistic-shape library, later).
- Decrement `lifespanTicks`; expire at 0 or off-map.
- Bullet–actor overlap is **not** done here — it's the hit step (7), after deflect (6), so a bullet blocked this tick never also registers a body hit this tick (ordering rationale in `08`).

Survivors are collected into a fresh array (funny's `survivors` pattern), never spliced in place.

## Step 6 — deflect (the swing IS the parry)

The pivot mechanic (`03`). Deflect is **not** a held state — it is part of a melee swing. For each actor whose melee swing is **active this tick** (`swingTicksLeft > 0` — the same `swingTicks` window step 7 uses; it was the one-tick `justSwung` latch until `ENGINE_VERSION` 53) and whose spec has `deflect`, test enemy bullets against the **swing's own arc** (the same `range`/`arcHalf` that damages enemies in step 7):

```
inArc(bullet, swinger):
  dx = bullet.gx − swinger.gx; dy = bullet.gy − swinger.gy
  dist = isqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
  if dist >= range: return false
  bulletBrad = atan2Brad(dy, dx)          // via fp-trig table, NOT Math.atan2
  return absBradDiff(bulletBrad, swinger.facing) < arcHalf
```

On a match (`03` "deflect"):

- **Flip faction** player↔enemy so it can now hit the original shooter's side.
- **Redirect velocity**: aim at the nearest opposite-faction actor (broad-phase nearest, id-tie-broken), else **mirror-reflect** about the swinger's facing. New velocity from `cos_fp/sin_fp` of the chosen brad at the weapon's `deflectSpeed`.
- Emit `deflect` (render plays the additive flash on the fx layer, `01`).
- Extension hooks (config, not launch): perfect-swing timing window → damage bonus; extra recovery. `05` notes deflect is already a commitment (it costs a swing) — any further costs are engine-config balance (`09`).

**The parry window is the damage window, deliberately** (`ENGINE_VERSION` 53). The locked decision above is "the SAME arc both damages enemies and deflects bullets — there is no separate `blockArc`", and an arc that damages for four ticks but parries for one is a separate `blockArc` in everything but name; both systems therefore gate on the one `swingTicksLeft` field. This *is* a real balance move on the pivot mechanic — the parry window went from one tick to 3-6 by weapon, and the golden set's `deflect` counts rose with it (5→7 in the dungeon scenario, 1→3 in the arena) — not a free refactor. It stands because the commitment `05` asks for is spending the swing, and frame-perfect parry timing was not readable at 30 Hz in the first place. Watch it in playtest; if parrying now reads as too cheap, the lever is `swingSec` per weapon, which is now a real number instead of dead data.

Deflect runs **before** hit resolution so a just-deflected bullet is already friendly when step 7 looks at it.

## Step 7 — hit resolution

**Bullets → bullets.** Resolved **first**, before the actor loop. Each overlapping opposite-faction bullet pair annihilates (both expire) — a bullet cancelled here can't also land a body hit this tick. Endpoint circle-overlap, `i<j` so a pair is tested once; push order breaks ties (deterministic, `08`). Emit `clash`. Deflect (`06`) flips faction first, so a just-parried bullet can clash with the volley it came from.

**Bullets → actors.** For each still-live bullet, swept-segment vs opposite-faction actor circles (broad phase), 2D only. On the **first** actor along the segment (nearest intersection): build the frozen payload, `resolveHit`, then expire the bullet — unless the weapon is `piercing`, in which case it continues and may hit further actors (funny's pierce, adapted to the swept path). Emit `hit`.

**Melee swings → actors.** ✅ **Shipped** (`ENGINE_VERSION` 53, 2026-09-02 — the paragraph below was the design from the start; only the last sentence used to describe the code). A swing is active for a few ticks (`swingTicks`); during active frames, test the weapon's arc (same `inArc` shape, using `arc`/`range` from `MeleeSpec`, `03`) against opposite-faction actors. Each target is hit **at most once per swing** (`WeaponState.swingHitIds`, cleared at each swing start — note "per swing", not per tick, which is the whole reason the list exists). On hit: `resolveHit` + apply `knockback` impulse in the swing direction. Emit `hit`.

The arc re-tests against the **live** facing and the **live** actor positions on every active tick, which is what makes it a window rather than a snapshot: a target that walks into the sector is caught, and a player who turns through their own swing carries the arc around with them (the "sweep"). What does *not* re-run is the payload — damage and the crit roll are frozen on the start tick into `WeaponState.swingDamage`, per "one frozen payload" above, so a 6-tick hammer deals its damage once and draws `combatPrng` once. `WeaponFireSystem` (step 3) owns both clocks: it loads `swingTicksLeft` from the spec on the swing tick and counts it down alongside the cooldown; `openSwing`/`closeSwing` (`content/weapons.ts`) are the only legal transitions, so no caller can latch half a swing.

**The render reads this window too** (`01`). `swingTicks` is what paces the rig's swing envelope and the sector fx (`client/src/render/rigAttackMotion.ts` `swingSchedule`, `client/src/game/fx/slashArc.ts`), anchored so the strike ends as the window closes — so the stroke a player sees covers the ticks that can actually connect. It gets there off the spec in `GameState`, not on the `melee_swing` event, which carries no weapon data on purpose: every client already holds the whole state, so an event field would be a second source of truth (`08`'s events-are-transient-facts rule, and `EventReactor.meleeSwinger`).

*Until `ENGINE_VERSION` 53 none of this was real.* `MeleeSpec.swingSec` had been authored on all seven melee weapons since Stage C — with this doc's own "07 step 7" wording in its doc comment and a row in `09`'s conversion table — but `toSimSpec` never converted it, `MeleeSimSpec` had no field for it, and nothing in the repo read it; `HitResolveSystem.meleeArc` resolved the entire arc on the single tick `justSwung` latched. Every blade therefore had a one-tick window and the hammer (0.2 s authored) and the spear (0.1 s) were identically timed. It survived 1104 green engine tests because every melee test staged a swing by hand-latching `justSwung` and asserting the hits on that same tick — the exact behaviour the bug produced. `systems/meleeWindow.test.ts` is the coverage for the other ticks.

`resolveHit(payload, target)` — the single shared resolver (funny's `resolveAttackHit`):

```
if target.invulnTicks > 0: return          // i-frames
raw = payload.rawDamage                      // crit already rolled & frozen at fire time
actual = target.takeDamage(raw)              // flat armor, min-1, integer → shield-first absorb (below)
target.invulnTicks = payload.invulnGrant     // start i-frames (0 for most bullets)
emit hit{ attackerId, targetId, damage: actual, hpRemaining: target.hp, shieldRemaining: target.shield }
if payload.knockback: add impulse to target.vx/vy in payload.dirBrad
if target.hp <= 0: target.dead = true        // sweep removes it in step 9

// takeDamage(effective) — two-pool absorb, shield before HP (05):
//   target.ticksSinceHit = 0                       // resets the shield-regen idle timer
//   hadShield = target.shield > 0
//   if target.shield >= effective: target.shield -= effective
//   else: effective -= target.shield; target.shield = 0; target.hp -= effective
//   if hadShield and target.shield == 0: emit shield_break{id} → fire bound break-passive (02)
```

Crit: ✅ **shipped** (`ENGINE_VERSION` 26, `balance/runbuffs.ts`) — at fire/swing time, `if critChance>0 && combatPrng.nextInt(1000) < critChance: raw = round(raw*CRIT_DAMAGE_MULT_PERMILLE/1000)` (funny's sketch, percent→per-mille to match this codebase's convention elsewhere). `critChance` is a Σ-clamp run-buff (`crit_up`, stacks like `dmg_up`/`rof_up`/`vit_up`); the multiplier is a fixed constant, not stacked. A build/enemy with `critChance=0` never advances `combatPrng`, keeping those replays independent — the same "hard wall" funny relies on. A ranged shot rolls once per pellet at fire time; a melee swing rolls ONCE for the whole arc (not per target), consistent with "one frozen payload, one swing."

### Damage types & on-hit status (shipped 2026-07-10, `ENGINE_VERSION` 8)

`resolveHit` (`applyHit`) is the single funnel for every hit — bullet or melee — and now does, in order:

1. **Resist** — per-type per-mille multiplier on the target; missing type = `1000`. Floors at 1. **Resistance** (`mult<1000`) truncates (`max(1, ⌊raw·mult/1000⌋)`) so it always reduces toward 1; **weakness** (`mult>1000`) *rounds* (`max(1, round(raw·mult/1000))`) so the bonus is visible even on a base-1 hit — otherwise `1×1.8` would truncate back to `1` and low-damage elemental weapons never show their weakness bonus (fixed `ENGINE_VERSION` 9). See `03`/`09`.
2. **Apply** — route `effective` through the two-pool `takeDamage` (shield-first absorb, resets `ticksSinceHit`, emits `shield_break` on depletion — locked decisions above); emit `hit{…, damageType, shieldRemaining}`.
3. **On-hit status by type** — `fire` starts/refreshes a **burn** (`burnTicks`, `burnDmg = max(1, hit>>1)`); `ice` starts a **chill** (`chillTicks`, `chillSlow` per-mille — `MovementSystem` scales that tick's displacement by `1000−slow`); `poison` pushes an independent **stack** (capped); `lightning` **chains** to the nearest other same-side actor within `CHAIN_RANGE` for `⌊dmg·½⌋` (one hop, no recursion, no further status). Emits a `status` event for fx.

The lingering effects are ticked in the new **Step 8 — status effects** (below), not here — `applyHit` only *starts* them. Determinism: all integer/fp; chain nearest is squared-distance (no trig); no PRNG draw, so damage types add no new random-draw site.

**Render treatment (per-element, `01` fx layer — render-only, reads state never writes it).** An elemental bullet draws in its element hue with an additive glow halo, and drops a fading trail dot each sim tick (a comet tail); physical rounds stay a plain faction-coloured dot with no trail. An actor under a lingering status wears a pulsing concentric ring per active effect (burn / chill / poison), mirrored from `actor.status` each reconcile — lightning has none (its chain is instant). All four reuse the same status-fx hues, so a fire shot, its trail, and the burn aura it leaves read as one colour. The transient `status`/`hit` events still drive the on-impact flash.

## Step 8 — status effects (elemental DoT / chill) & shield regen

*✅ Shipped (`StatusEffectSystem`): DoT since `ENGINE_VERSION` 8; the shield-regen sub-pass added in ROADMAP 0.4 (`ENGINE_VERSION` 12).* Runs after hit resolution (7) and **before** death & drops (now 9), so a burn/poison kill is swept and rolls a drop the same tick as a direct-hit kill. For every alive actor:

- On a **DoT-cadence tick** (`state.tick % DOT_INTERVAL == 0`): apply `burnDmg` if burning, and the summed damage of all poison stacks — each routed through the two-pool `takeDamage` (**shield-first**, so a shield can soak a burn; **resets `ticksSinceHit`**, so a lingering DoT keeps shield regen suppressed). A DoT that empties the shield emits `shield_break` like any other hit.
- **Age** every timer by one tick; burn/chill reset their magnitude at expiry (so a later weaker application can't inherit a stale value — HitResolve keeps the MAX burn tick while active); expired poison stacks are compacted out in push order.
- **Shield regen (idle timer).** After the DoT sub-pass, advance `ticksSinceHit` by one for every actor. If `ticksSinceHit ≥ SHIELD_REGEN_DELAY` (~3 s) and it lands on a `SHIELD_REGEN_INTERVAL` (~2 s) boundary, `shield = min(maxShield, shield + 1)`. Doing this *after* the DoT sub-pass means an actor that took a DoT tick this frame already had its timer zeroed and cannot regen — the "clear your status to recover" rule falls out for free. Regen only *adds* shield, never kills, so its position relative to death (9) is immaterial; keeping it in this per-actor pass avoids a second full actor walk.

Chill is *read* one step earlier (Movement, step 4) using the value set by a prior tick's hit — the slow applies from the next movement pass, standard for a status.

## Step 9 — death & drops

Single sweep over each entity array, ascending id:

- `dead` **enemy** → emit `death{id, pos, faction, type}`; if it has an `onDeathSpawn` (boss adds, funny's `onDeathSpawn`), spawn minions at its position; **roll `dropPrng`** against the drop table (`05`/`09`) → push a `Pickup`, which may be a **weapon** (in-run, ephemeral), a **healing item** (flat `+1` HP), or **materials** (the only carry-out — banked at extraction rooms, `05`). Then remove from the array.
- `dead` **player** → don't remove; mark `downed` and freeze it in place. A teammate standing in range holding `INTERACT` runs a **revive channel** (~15 s, config `09`); completing it restores the player to a small HP amount. The channel is interruptible (the reviver moving/being downed cancels it). Revive count, downed-player vulnerability, and total-team-wipe handling are `05`'s open questions. Win-condition check (step 12, `08`) reads `downed`.

Drops spawned this tick are **not collectable until next tick's pickup pass** (step 10), per `08`'s ordering rule — no kill-and-vacuum in one frame.

## Events emitted (engine → render, `08`)

`bullet_fired · bullet_moved · bullet_expired · clash · deflect · hit · melee_swing · knockback · shield_break · death · downed · revive_progress · revived · pickup_spawned · pickup_taken · hp_changed · shield_changed`. Transient, consumed once per render frame; they drive fx/audio only and never feed back into logic. `shield_break` also *triggers* a character break-passive, but that resolves inside the sim (a spawned AoE / knockback impulse), not in render. Positions in fp; render converts with `fromFp`.

## Determinism checklist (this doc's surface)

- ✅ All distance/gap/velocity in `Fp`; distance via `isqrt`; **zero `Math.sqrt`**.
- ✅ All angles integer brad; arc/aim/reflect via `06`'s `cos_fp/sin_fp/atan2Brad` tables; **zero `Math.atan2/sin/cos`**.
- ✅ Crit/drop rolls via injected `combatPrng`/`dropPrng`; **zero `Math.random`**.
- ✅ Broad-phase & pair resolution iterate by ascending id / cell index; no `Set`/`Map` order leaks.
- ⚠️ Swept tests are the *design* here, and step 5 above describes them — but `ProjectileStepSystem` currently ships an **endpoint** test (`circleOverlapsAabb(b.gx, b.gy, b.radius, w)` at the post-move position, its own comment conceding "swept test is 07"). Behaviour is therefore speed-dependent and a fast enough bullet CAN tunnel a thin wall. Tracked in `design/18-test-strategy.md` (G6); the checkmark returns when the swept test lands, which is an outcome-moving change and bumps `ENGINE_VERSION`.
- ✅ Golden-replay: same seed + same input stream → identical hits, deaths, drops (`06` step-5 check). Any change here that alters outcomes bumps `ENGINE_VERSION` (`08`).

## Relationship to the other docs

- **`08`:** owns the `step()` order and `GameState`; this doc is the body of steps 4–9. `Projectile`/`Pickup`/i-frame fields added here live on `GameState` arrays.
- **`06`:** fp/brad/PRNG rules and the fp-trig module every arc/ballistic here depends on.
- **`03`:** `RangedSpec`/`MeleeSpec` (fire rate, spread, arc, range, `deflect`, knockback) are the *inputs* to steps 5–7; block/deflect is realized in step 6.
- **`05`:** drop tables, revive/team-wipe, and the "deflect must be a commitment" PvP tuning feed steps 6/8.
- **`01`:** the `gx/gy` ground plane collision resolves in. `z` is render-only in `01`'s fake-3D lift; it is not a gameplay dimension here (no height gating).

## To design

- ✅ **`RoomState` collision-geometry schema** — shipped 2026-07-24 (ROADMAP 1.2): `RoomPiece` (`content/rooms.ts`, `09`) holds `solids`/`pillars`/`spawns`/`exits`/`encounter`/`role` in human grid units, plus the pure `roomGeometry()` converter to sim `AABB[]`/`Obstacle[]`. *Remaining:* actually placing pieces into a live `GameState` (the hand-authored library + seeded layout) is `05`'s dungeon assembly, ROADMAP 1.3.
- **Ballistic-shape library** (`03`): straight/arcing/homing/boomerang/pattern — each is a per-tick velocity update rule slotted into step 5. Bounce/pierce/homing are the first extensions.
- **Knockback & i-frame numbers**, perfect-swing window — all engine config (`09`), tuned against real play (`05`).
- **Shield tuning & break-passive catalog** — first-pass shipped (ROADMAP 0.4/0.5): `SHIELD_REGEN_DELAY` (90t/~3s) / `SHIELD_REGEN_INTERVAL` (60t/~2s, was 300t/~10s until `ENGINE_VERSION` 41 — `05` "Room encounter budget") in `config.ts`; the tagged `ShieldBreakPassive` (`aoe` burst radius/damage, `knock` impulse) on `SkinDef`; the recursion guard is implemented (a break-passive hit calls `takeDamage(…, firePassive=false)`, so a break can't trigger another). *Remaining:* final numbers, the revive channel length + restored-HP (Phase 3 co-op).
- ✅ **Persistent-knockback friction — shipped (`ENGINE_VERSION` 24→25).** Actor gained `knockVx`/`knockVy`, a channel independent of `vx`/`vy` (needed because a player's vx/vy is fully overwritten every tick by `ApplyInputSystem` from input, and an enemy's is never touched by AI at all — writing a shove into vx/vy directly, as the `knock` shield-break passive used to, was either erased before Movement ever saw it or would have drifted forever with no decay). `MovementSystem.integrate` adds `knockVx/knockVy` into this tick's displacement (unaffected by chill slow — a shove is an external force, not movement speed) then decays it by `KNOCKBACK_FRICTION_PERMILLE` (config.ts, first-pass 800 = keep 80%/tick), snapping to exactly 0 below `KNOCKBACK_SNAP_FP`. Also closed a second, adjacent gap found while implementing this: every `MeleeSpec.knockback` (saber/hammer/emberblade/frostbrand/stormglaive/spear) had been authored in grid/s since Stage C but `toSimSpec` never converted it and `HitResolveSystem` never applied it — a swing's knockback was pure flavour text. Both now land: `HitResolveSystem.meleeArc` shoves a connected target outward along the same attacker→target direction already used for the arc test.
- **Broad-phase cell size** vs typical bullet speed (cell must be ≥ max per-tick bullet travel, or the swept test must span multiple cells).

## Open questions

- **Pierce vs swept path:** a piercing bullet crossing several actors in one tick — hit *all* on the segment this tick, or one per tick? All-on-segment is more correct but needs the swept test to return an ordered hit list.
- **Deflect redirect target:** nearest enemy (feels aim-assisted, good for casual `05`) vs pure mirror-reflect (skill-expressive). Possibly per-weapon. Decide against real play.
- **Actor–actor push in tight rooms:** pure push-apart can jitter when many bodies pack a corner; may need a max-push clamp or priority (players over enemies). No clamp exists yet (the shipped `resolveActorPairs` is the plain unclamped push-apart) — watch in playtest, add one if it jitters for real.
- **Enemy-enemy collision:** ✅ **resolved — every pair pushes apart, no faction exception** (`ENGINE_VERSION` 42, 2026-08-17). Originally resolved the other way (`resolveActorPairs` skipped enemy-vs-enemy pairs so packed rooms could lean overlap); reverted on a live report — *"怪物之间要有碰撞"* — because what it actually produced was a garrison converging into one spot and stacking into a single blob of overlapping sprites, so the player could neither count the threat nor tell what they were shooting at. The faction check is gone entirely. It also composes with v42's perception radius (`05`, "Room feel pass"): mobs now arrive in waves rather than as one column, so there is much less sustained mutual pushing to pay for. `ENGINE_VERSION` bumped both times, for the outcome change.
- **Melee vs bullet-cloud cost:** a wide swing arc tested against every nearby bullet each active frame — is the broad phase enough on WeChat low-end under a full bullet-hell? Ties to `06`'s 30 vs 20 Hz open question. **This got 3-6x more expensive at `ENGINE_VERSION` 53**, and the wording above finally means what it says: "each active frame" used to be one frame, because the window was one tick. `DeflectSystem` now walks `state.projectiles` once per active tick per swinging player (still a linear scan — it never used the broad phase), and `HitResolveSystem.meleeArc` walks `hostileTargets` the same way. Neither is measured on a real device yet. The cheap fix if it bites is the broad phase this bullet has been asking for since it was written, not a shorter window.
