# Worldview & art direction

The game's **visual identity and the fiction that wraps it** — the setting that makes the locked systems (`05` loop, `03` elements, `09` content) feel like one world, and the art rules that keep it readable on WeChat (`04`) and cheap to produce for a **high-DAU, shallow-monetization** title (`14` breadth-not-power meta). Sibling to `12` (which owns the *pipeline* — how pixels load and animate); this doc owns *what the world is and what it looks like*, `12` owns *how the assets are built*.

> **Art-first (locked 2026-07-23).** The visual identity was designed **first**, and the worldview reverse-engineered from it. The earlier "reclaimer-diver humanoid" concept trio (`art/concept/`) is **retired** — it read as generic post-apoc survival, contradicted the plucky tone, and was over-rendered for the flat-cel cut-out pipeline (`12`). The direction below replaces it. The prompts that produced the accepted concepts are archived in `art/concept/prompts.md` for future iteration.

## Visual identity (locked)

### The protagonist — a floating orb-core, not a humanoid

The hero is a **small hovering spherical core**: one rounded shell, **no arms, no legs**, a single large expressive eye, a transparent belly chamber that fills with glowing crystal, and **two weapon modules that orbit it** on glowing energy tethers. It floats (bob + lean into travel; squash-stretch on accel) — there is no walk cycle. *(The tether is **drawn**, not authored art — a glowing arc from a bone's pivot to its tip, opt-in per bone; the assembly of all of the above shipped visibly broken until 2026-08-17, see `12`'s update log.)*

This body plan was chosen because it wins on all four production constraints at once:

| Constraint | Why the orb-core wins |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Cheap to animate** | No legs → no locomotion cycle; the rig is near-trivial (a root + orbiting mount points), *simpler* than a humanoid, not harder. |
| **Cheap / consistent to draw** | One bold radially-ish-symmetric shape stays on-model across frames and characters; front/back sets nearly collapse (`12` facing model). |
| **Distinctive silhouette** | A round core with orbiting weapons + a glowing belly reads as *one game* at app-icon size — the brand hook nothing else in the genre has. |
| **Fits the weapon system** | The two orbiting modules **are** the two weapon slots (`02`/`03`); the `orbit` ballistic (`03`) already exists in the frame catalog. |

**The brand hook (icon / marketing):** the orbiting weapon modules + the belly that fills with element-colored crystal as you collect. Diegetic (it is your extraction canister), it is the silhouette, and it doubles as a live HUD.

### Characters are a roster, not skins

There is **no base-character-plus-skin hierarchy and no cosmetic-only skin** (`02`/`05`/`14`). Instead the game ships a **flat roster of distinct characters**, each a fully themed orb-core in this art language (e.g. a Sun-Wukong core — golden-fur shell, crown-shaped crystal spikes, a fiery eye). This is the collection/monetization hook for the DAU model: "unlock a new character" carries far more perceived value and social pull than "buy a skin."

Hard boundary that keeps this from fighting the weapon system:

> **A character's theme lives entirely on the orb** — shell, eye, crystal-spike motif, belly — **and never on the weapons.** Weapons are shared in-run loot (`05`) that plug into the same universal socket regardless of who is carrying them. A Wukong core still picks up and mounts the same fire sword any other character would.

Characters are **balanced side-grades**, not power tiers: each carries only a `(maxHp, maxShield)` pair + one shield-break passive (`02`/`05`), tuned as a distinct playstyle of equal worth. In PvP a paying player gets **more selectable characters** (breadth / comfort picks / counter-picks), never more power — the accepted "pay for access, not for power" model, held fair by keeping the **free starter roster playstyle-complete** and by the side-grade balance discipline in `14`. The silhouette should read the character's *archetype* (a fragile skirmisher vs a tanky core), not hide it. Launch scope is **3 characters**, then slow additions (a new one every ~2–6 months), so the balance surface stays small.

### Weapons — a universal mount socket

Every weapon is a **module that plugs into a standard socket** (the orbiting mount). The socket is identical across all weapons; only the **business end** differs — a barrel, a beam emitter, a crystal blade, a hammer head. This is what lets the `03` **Frame × Element × Affix** roster explode from few pieces without the art fighting it:

- **Any frame fits any character** — ranged and melee share one mount, validated by concept (a gun barrel and a crystal blade plugging into the identical socket).
- **Element = the crystal's colour** — swap the glowing crystal colour to swap element (`03`); the housing is unchanged. A per-weapon **element icon badge** rides on the housing (see the colour law below).
- **Tether length = melee reach** — a short tether is a dagger's tight sweep, a long one a spear's poke; an emergent, free mapping onto `03`'s `dagger/saber/hammer/spear` reach.
- **Melee swing = the socket sweeping an arc around the core** — that swept sector *is* the deflect sector (`03`'s "the arc that hits enemies is the arc that bats bullets back").

This **replaces** the old humanoid `gear_hand` + per-weapon `grip` mounting model (`02`/`03`/`12`).

### Enemies — the corrupted-crystal mirror

Enemies share the hero's DNA — **living crystal, single glowing eye** — but are its **failed opposite**: raw, jagged, wild-grown crystal over a cracked core, where the hero is a polished, contained shell. One base creature is **re-tinted** into the element variants (`09`'s render-only `tint`): a squat single-eyed crystal critter → **emberling / frostling / galvanist / ironclad** — fire / ice / lightning / **physical** (`ironclad` is the physical-resistant, armour-plated one) — told apart by colour + icon alone. **Poison has no dedicated critter yet** (the poison read currently lives on the `blightlord` boss, which is *weak* to it, `09`); a poison-tinted variant is a later add. Roster variety beyond the base body (a heavy brute, a floating ranged form) is a later pass.

The **boss closes the loop thematically**: it is a **giant failed core** — a huge cracked crystal core with orbiting shard rings — the same kind of thing the player *is*, but corrupted. Hero and final boss are the two poles of one object.

### Style & the colour law

- **Flat-cel "半平涂".** Bold clean uniform outlines, flat solid colour fills, simple soft cel shadows, minimal internal detail, strong readable silhouette. Deliberately **flatter than rendered concept art** — cut-out parts (`12`) rotate every frame, so baked lighting/texture would break, and a DAU title must produce content (characters, enemies, weapons) **cheaply and on-model**. The accepted weapon/melee concepts are the **flatness benchmark**; the enemy concepts are slightly over-rendered (lava texture, gloss) and must be flattened one notch in production.
- **Element = colour is a hard gameplay rule, dual-channel.** A **closed five-colour language** drives all combat legibility: **fire = orange-red, ice = pale blue, lightning = bright yellow, poison = sickly green, physical = neutral white/grey.** Lightning and poison were pulled fully off the shared violet they could each drift toward — pure yellow vs. pure green, no violet left in either — for a cleaner split than a violet-tinted version of each would read. Every weapon / enemy / status also carries a small matching **element icon badge** (flame / snowflake / bolt / skull / gem). Colour sets the mood, the icon is the legibility backstop (small size, colour-blind, dark background). This dual channel is **locked** and governs bullet trails, status auras (`07`), enemy `tint` (`09`), weapon crystal, and biome accents.
- **Environment desaturated, hazards saturated.** Base stonework/terrain is low-chroma so the *interactive* bits — element FX, loot crystals, blight glow, the orbiting weapons — pop. The poison biome's ambient green must be dialled down and poison must **not** be the first biome, or green FX/enemies camouflage against a green floor.
- **Biome identity = element theme + palette shift**, cheap to swap via `12`'s lazy per-biome bundles.

### Element palette (locked 2026-07-27)

The hex values already driving combat FX (`client/src/game/theme.ts`'s `THEME.colors`/`ELEMENT_COLORS`) — this is that "concrete per-element hex" the list below used to call out as undecided; it's just the shipped values confirmed and written down, not a new choice:

| Element | Hex | Used as |
|---|---|---|
| Fire | `#FF7043` | `statusBurn` — bullet trail, burn aura, `emberling` tint |
| Ice | `#81D4FA` | `statusChill` — bullet trail, chill aura |
| Lightning | `#FFF176` | `statusShock` — bullet trail, chain-hit flash |
| Poison | `#9CCC65` | `statusPoison` — bullet trail, poison-stack aura |
| Physical | `#E2E8F0` | no dedicated status FX (physical has no on-hit status) — the same neutral already used for the `gun`/`sword`/rarity-white palette entries |

> **Drift fixed:** `frostling`/`galvanist` (`content/enemies.ts`) were originally authored independently of the FX table above (`0x4fc3f7`/`0xffd54f`, close-but-different shades of the ice/lightning hues) — now unified to the exact `#81D4FA`/`#FFF176` FX values, alongside `emberling` which already matched fire exactly. `ironclad`'s `0x90a4ae` steel-grey remains its own physical-flavoured tint (deliberately not `#E2E8F0` — armour-plate flavour, not the neutral FX colour) and `blightlord`'s `0x8e24aa` toxic purple remains the boss's own flavour colour, unrelated to poison's FX hue (poison still has no dedicated critter, see above) — both intentional, not drift.

## Worldview (reverse-engineered from the art, locked)

- **Setting — the Blight (枯潮).** A spreading contamination is **crystallising** the world along **elemental lines** — fire / ice / lightning / poison. Each expresses as a different contaminated zone, which is why the run's floors are **elemental biomes** (`05`), the enemies are **wild crystal-blooms** corrupted by each element (the `09` variants emberling/frostling/galvanist/ironclad), and the boss is a **giant failed core**.
- **Role — a purifier core (提纯核).** You are a **purpose-built reclaimer core** — a small clean floating machine-being — that dives into contaminated zones to **siphon corrupted matter and refine it into pure crystal**, banking it before the Blight claims it (the belly literally fills). You are the **polished, contained** counterpart to the wild crystal creatures.
- **Tone — bright, luminous, hopeful.** Post-contamination but plucky and beautiful-dangerous, not grim, not horror. The crystal glows; the world is stylised, not gory. You are *reclaiming*, diving a little deeper and getting a little stronger each run — which is exactly the name **DayDayUp (天天向上, "better every day")** and the casual WeChat audience.

### The fiction earns every locked rule

The art-first setting still makes each locked mechanic diegetic:

| Locked rule (`05`/`09`) | In-world reason |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Weapons are ephemeral (wiped at run end) | Weapons found/refined in a zone are **contaminated crystal** — stable inside, they decay the moment they leave |
| Only materials carry out | Materials = **stabilised, purified** crystal — the one thing safe to extract (what your belly banks) |
| A brought weapon is single-use, costs materials | You **refine one unstable weapon** from materials for the dive; it survives one run, like any in-zone weapon (`05`/`14`) |
| Deeper floors → better materials | Deeper = **closer to the Blight source** → purer, more valuable crystal (and more dangerous) |
| Extraction rooms are checkpoints | **Decontamination gates** — passing one locks in what you have refined |
| Meta sells breadth, not power (`14`: blueprints + side-grade characters) | A safe **outpost / workshop** forges materials into loadout gear and takes in new **core models** (characters) |
| Elemental enemy variants + boss | Wild crystal-blooms corrupted by each element; the boss is a **failed / overgrown core** |

## Relationship to the other docs

- **`12`:** the pipeline that produces and animates these assets. The orb-core drops the humanoid rig — the rig is our own (`12`), and the weapon mount is an orbiting **socket**, not `gear_hand`.
- **`01`:** the tilted view + colour/glow the element language rides on.
- **`02`/`05`/`14`:** characters-are-a-roster (defensive identity + break passive, side-grade balanced), the biome/economy loop the fiction wraps, and the enemy `tint`/variant data the colour law drives.
- **`03`:** weapon looks inherit the element colour law and plug into the universal mount; melee sweep = deflect arc.

## To design

- ~~**Per-biome background palettes**~~ — **shipped 2026-07-28, as a code palette, not new art**: `game/theme.ts biomePalette()` derives ground/grid/pillar/wall colours per biome from this doc's already-locked element hex table (a small blend toward each hue, kept subtle per this doc's own "environment desaturated, hazards saturated" rule) — `DungeonConfig.biomeId` → `ELEMENT_COLORS` vocabulary, one new map entry per future biome. **Update (2026-08-18): these are now explicitly the NO-ART-LOADED fallback, not the shipped look.** Once real swatches landed (next bullet) the two roles diverged and nobody noticed: the palette blends each element's hue into a slate base, so the ember pillar colour is a pale mauve, while every shipped swatch is the charcoal-navy stone `art/biome/prompts.md` specifies. Pillars were still drawn from the palette, and once `01`'s standing-wall pass made the walls read as real stone those four pale-mauve cylinders became the worst thing in the frame. Pillars now carry their own hand-toned stone (`scene/wallRender.ts`), and anything with real art derives its tones from that art. The palette is still the right thing for a biome with no swatch yet (poison) and for the backdrop `void` — it just is not where a textured object's colour comes from.
- ~~**The other biomes' looks**~~ — **shipped 2026-08-02**: real tileable floor/wall swatches for fire/ice/lightning/neutral (`client/public/biome/{floor,wall}_{fire,ice,lightning,neutral}.png`), generated after two prior attempts came back in the wrong style/shape (painterly isometric illustrated rooms, not flat-cel orthographic swatches — see `art/biome/prompts.md`'s explicit "NOT a scene/room" language, which is what finally fixed it). `render/biomeTiles.ts` preloads them (same non-blocking pattern as `uiSkins.ts`) and `RoomBuilder.ts` renders via `TilingSprite` when a swatch exists, falling back to the pre-existing flat palette fill otherwise (`RoomBuilder.test.ts` now covers both paths). Poison deliberately still has no swatch — it isn't floor 1 and has no dedicated critter either, per this doc's own note; `RoomBuilder`'s flat-fill fallback covers it until a poison biome is actually scheduled. **Update (2026-08-18): a second wall asset joined them — `wallface_{fire,ice,lightning,neutral}.png`, the wall's front ELEVATION**, because the swatches above turned out to be only half a wall: they were being laid flat on the wall's own footprint, so the tilted view's promised "small front face" (`01`) existed on pillars and nowhere else. Walls now stand, with the elevation as the face and the original swatch reused unchanged as the top cap — see `01` "Standing walls" for the geometry and `art/biome/prompts.md` for the prompt (its seam rule is deliberately different from every other swatch here: left-right only).
- ~~**The 3 launch characters**~~ — **shipped 2026-07-27**: `vanguard` (the balanced default, cream/gold orb, already bound `12`), `skirmisher` (a Sun-Wukong-themed core — golden fur shell, crystal crown, fire-orange belly/eye — the fragile-high-shield agile pick) and `juggernaut` (a frost-guardian core — pale-blue armoured shell, ice-cyan belly/eye — the flat-HP tank pick) round out the roster, each a distinct themed orb-core on the shared rig (`content/skins.ts`'s `atlasKey`s `char_vanguard`/`char_skirmisher`/`char_juggernaut`). Which one anchors marketing is still open.
- ~~**Enemy body variety**~~ — beyond the re-tinted base critter: the boss core shipped 2026-07-27; **the brute + floating ranged form shipped 2026-07-28** (`content/enemies.ts`'s `brute`/`floater` blueprints, `09`'s new `bodyRig` field, reusing critter-core's rig). Nothing left open here.
- ~~**Outpost / hub look**~~ — **shipped 2026-08-01, NPC gap closed 2026-08-02**: a real hub background (`client/public/ui/hub_bg.png`) — a floating repair-dock platform, warm neutral stone/beige palette (deliberately kept off the ice-blue hue this doc reserves for combat FX), small crystal accents only, matching this doc's "environment desaturated" rule — plus matching icon glyphs for every menu button across `MainMenu`/`LoginScreen`/`PauseMenu`/`PartyScreen`/`Forge` (PLAY/SQUAD/LOGIN/SETTINGS plus the later REGISTER/CHANGE PASSWORD/LOG OUT/BACK/QUIT TO FORGE/CREATE PARTY/JOIN WITH CODE/LEAVE PARTY/CLEAR LOADOUT pass) and the run-outcome win/loss badges (`client/public/ui/icon_*.png`). Shared by every menu-shaped screen, all built on the common `ui/widgets.ts` `Panel`, non-blocking preload (`render/uiSkins.ts`) so a missing file just falls back to the pre-existing flat colour/plain text — `uiSkins.test.ts` now covers that fallback contract directly. The Forger NPC — a stationary, blocky/industrial orb-core variant with a hammer + tongs on the hero's own universal weapon-mount tethers instead of weapons, warm stone/beige/gold palette with a small ember-orange glow accent — is bound into `Forge.ts` as a corner-anchored decorative sprite (`client/public/ui/npc_forger.png`), hidden until its texture exists AND the viewport has room beside the row column (`Forge.npc.test.ts`). First-pass generations for the hub, the squad icon, and (twice) the NPC were rejected and regenerated: the hub came back painterly-isometric (`01`'s rejected style), the squad icon read as disconnected googly eyes, and the NPC's first accepted-on-style pass came back on an opaque grey background instead of a real transparent one (caught by decoding pixel alpha directly, not by eye — the preview render looked identical either way). Originals + rejects kept in `art/ui/*_raw.png`/`*_alt.png` and `art/npc/*_raw.png`/`*_alt.png` (matching `art/weapon`'s naming).
- ~~**HUD art**~~ — **closed 2026-08-02 with no new assets, by rule**: the rebuilt in-match HUD (`10`) shows the character's own rig `shell` texture as its portrait and the weapon's own business-end texture as its item icon — the *same* files the world renderer mounts (`render/skinRegistry`/`render/weaponSkins`, `12`). No headshots, no separate icon set. This is the standing rule, not a shortcut: a HUD icon that is a second drawing of the same object drifts from it, and a new character or weapon would need two assets instead of one. The only bespoke HUD art is the stat-chip glyph set, and those are drawn as vectors in code (`ui/hudIcons.ts`) so they can be tinted per stat from the palettes this doc already locks.
- **Biome difficulty/order** — fire/ice/lightning + neutral now all have real looks (above), but which biome comes first/second/etc. and where poison eventually slots in (kept off floor 1 regardless, per this doc's "environment desaturated" note about green-on-green camouflage) is a `05` balance question, not an art one — still open.
- **Rarity vs element colour namespace** — the five element hues are reserved for combat FX; weapon **rarity** (白→蓝→紫→橙→金, `14`) must read via border + a per-rarity ornament/emissive overlay on the sprite, without colliding with the element language. Concrete overlay spec is still open.
- **Shipping title** — is "DayDayUp" the final name or a codename? The Blight/crystal-core setting may suggest a title.
