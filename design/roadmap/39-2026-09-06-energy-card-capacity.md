# Work log — 2026-09-06: the three things volume 38 wrote down and did not do

Volume 39. One `ENGINE_VERSION` bump (60) closing two of the three gaps volume 38 named for
itself, plus the third one turned from an open question into a written-down prompt.

Indexed from [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md).

## The energy card, and the first buff a floor can never drop (2026-09-06, engine + client, `ENGINE_VERSION` 60)

Volume 38's own words: *"a fifth buff family touches `RUN_BUFFS`/`BUFF_CAPS`/`applyBuff` and
wants its own measured pass."* This is that pass.

The mechanical half is small and follows `flat_hp` exactly. `RunBuffKind` grew `flat_energy`,
`RUN_BUFFS` grew `cell_up` (+30), `BUFF_CAPS` grew a ceiling of 120 — four picks exactly, so
no pick is ever a fractional dud — and `FLOOR_CARDS` grew `capacitor`, which grants it.
`PickupSystem.applyBuff` now reads ONE `sumBuffs` pair and applies both absolute families off
it, so the two deltas cannot disagree about which stack they were computed from, and it grows
the current value alongside the ceiling for energy exactly as it already did for HP.

That last part is the one thing in this half worth arguing about, and the argument decided it:
a card that raised the cap without filling it would hand a player who took it *while empty*
nothing at all until regen caught up — which is precisely the moment they picked it for.

### The interesting half: it is deliberately undroppable

`cell_up` is the only id in the catalogue that `BUFF_DROP_POOL` cannot roll.

The reason is that it is the first **conditional** reward in the set. The other four families
are worth something to every player in every run; capacity is worth exactly nothing to a
player still on the starter blaster, which volume 38 deliberately priced *below* the regen
line, so a fresh save's bar never empties at all. As a fifth entry in the drop pool that would
spend a fifth of a run's buff drops on a reward most players cannot yet use — paid for by
diluting four families that always do something.

A pick-one-of-three offer is the right home for a reward whose value depends on what you are
currently holding. The player carrying a 26-cost frame takes `capacitor`; the player carrying
a blaster takes `edge`; neither pick is wasted, which is not true of a drop.

`content/drops.ts`'s new `CARD_ONLY_BUFF_IDS` names the exclusion rather than leaving it as an
absence, and `drops.test.ts` requires every catalogue id to appear in **exactly one** of the
two lists. Without that, "deliberately undroppable" and "somebody forgot to add it to the
pool" look identical from outside, and the second one ships a buff no player can ever obtain.

### One bug this pass created and caught in the same breath

`floorCardDescVars`' absolute arm was keyed on the literal `'flat_hp'`. `capacitor` fell
through to the per-mille branch, and a 30-point buff rendered as **"+3 max energy"** — in
eight locales, with nothing in the tree failing. It is keyed on the `flat_` prefix now, and
the test that pins it says what it is for.

## `MAX_ENERGY` becomes a character stat (same version)

Volume 38 deferred this with a real reason, not a shrug: making capacity a character trait
*"would put a raw ammo ladder on the one meta axis that reaches PvP."*

What resolves it is a property of the pool rather than a compromise about it:

> **Capacity buys burst. It provably cannot buy sustain.** Energy regen is a flat shared
> constant, so on an empty bar every character in the game fires at exactly
> `ENERGY_REGEN_PER_SEC / energyCost` shots per second no matter how big their pool is. A
> deeper bar is a longer opening, never a higher ceiling.

So the worst a paid character could ever be sold on this axis is *front-loaded*, not
*stronger* — which is the thing `design/14`'s side-grade rule actually forbids.

`MAX_ENERGY` is now `BASE_MAX_ENERGY`, documented as what it always really was: the reference
pool the whole `energyCost` table was priced against, and the default character's own. That
identity is pinned — if `vanguard`'s capacity drifts off it, every price in
`content/weaponSpecs/` is silently re-based and nothing else in the tree would say so.

### The roster spreads opposite to the body

| character | body | pool | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skirmisher` | 3 HP / 6 shield | **130** | cannot win a long trade, so it gets the longest short one |
| `vanguard` | 6 / 3.2 | **100** | the reference pool, by definition |
| `juggernaut` | 11 / 0 | **70** | its fights are long by construction, and length is the regime where capacity stops mattering |

`skins.test.ts` pins that DIRECTION by name — deepest pool on the smallest body — not merely
that the three differ. A pass that flipped it would still satisfy Pareto non-domination and
the per-axis spread check while making the fragile character strictly worse in both regimes.

Three consequences that each needed deciding rather than falling out:

- **The Pareto rule widened to the triple, and got STRICTER doing it** — a would-be
  all-rounder now has one more column it has to lose on. Note which way that cuts: it would
  now be *legal* to hand a character both the biggest body and the biggest shield as long as
  it had the smallest pool. Which is why the equal-worth budget band still sums only the two
  DEFENSIVE axes. Energy is not denominated in hit points; adding them would be an invented
  exchange rate of exactly the kind `design/03` refuses to make up, and at ~100 it would
  swamp a 9-point body budget outright.
- **`ENERGY_PICKUP_AMOUNT` stays a flat 30**, so a refill is worth proportionally more to the
  shallow bar than to the deep one — the juggernaut's compensation, now pinned so a later
  pass cannot quietly turn it into a fraction of `maxEnergy` and hand the deepest bar the
  biggest refill as well.
- **The arena carries it through UNSCALED.** `PVP_SCALE_FACTOR` multiplies `maxHp`/`maxShield`
  *because* it multiplies weapon damage alongside them, which is what preserves relative TTK.
  `energyCost` is not scaled at all, so a ×5 pool would not preserve a ratio — it would delete
  the ammo economy from PvP outright. Asserted against the raw `SkinDef` number rather than
  against "not 5×", so the claim survives a retune of the factor.

The "every gun gets at least two shots off a full bar" gate also moved off the reference pool
onto the roster's **smallest**. At the old bound a 40-cost weapon could have shipped that
`juggernaut` fires once and `vanguard` fires twice — the one asymmetry a shared price table
must not have.

## The A/B came back byte-identical, and that turned out to be the finding

The PvP sim reported **85/36/56** win rates with the per-character pools, and **85/36/56**
with every pool flattened back to v59's constant. Identical to the match.

Volume 38's own lesson says what to do with that: a null result is only evidence the change
is safe if the instrument can see the change at all. A probe over 8 arena matches answered it
— **no seat's bar ever drops more than one blaster shot below full.** The landing kit is
sustainable on regen alone and the bot never swaps to a looted frame, so capacity in PvP is
not "measured and fine", it is *unmeasured*, exactly like the melee-share 0% v59 named.

### So the sim grew the column that can tell those apart

`report.ts`'s fire table gained **`dry%`** — the share of a floor's live ticks on which the
player held a ranged weapon it could not afford to pull. Deliberately not "energy === 0" (a
26-cost frame is already disarmed at 25 while a 3-cost blaster is not disarmed until 2, so a
raw zero-check would report the cheap gun as the constrained one — the exact inversion of what
the economy does), and deliberately denominated in LIVE TICKS rather than in pulls (a player
who cannot afford to fire is not firing, so a pull-denominated version would fall to zero
exactly when pressure is highest).

Holding the character fixed and varying only the pool, 8 careful bot runs of the shipped
level:

| pool | floor 0 | floor 1 | floor 2 | avg floor reached |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | 0% | 21% | 16% | 0.75 |
| 70 | 0% | 2% | 2% | 0.75 |
| 100 (shipped default) | 0% | 0% | 4% | 0.75 |
| 130 | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0.75 |

Three readings, and only the first was the one being looked for:

- **Capacity is measurable, and it is a texture stat rather than a power stat.** `dry%` moves
  with the pool; average floor reached does not move at all, at any pool, including one less
  than half the shipped floor.
- **It only ever bites deep, and not for the reason the design assumed.** Floor 0 is 0% even
  at a pool of 30, because the starter blaster is below break-even and capacity is by
  construction irrelevant to any weapon that is. What bites on floors 1-2 is a `rof_up` stack
  pushing that same blaster *over* the line — not an expensive frame, which the bot never
  fires. The ammo economy's only live pressure on a fresh save today comes from a buff that is
  supposed to be pure upside.
- The floor-2 inversion between 70 (2%) and 100 (4%) is not a measurement of capacity. A
  refusal changes the tick pattern, so the runs diverge outright — they kill 35.7 and 40
  respectively. Floor 1 is the comparable row.

## After

`npm run check`, `npm run check:logic`, the 90/90 coverage gate and all four sims green. The
golden witness was read BEFORE the bump, which is the only time it is readable at all
(`serializeState` hashes `ENGINE_VERSION` itself, so afterwards every fixture hash has moved):
**exactly one scenario diverged, `launch-arena-pvp`** — the only one that seats a non-default
character. Every PvE fixture still matched, which is the empirical form of the claim that
`vanguard` still carries the reference pool.

| | v59 | v60 |
|---|---|---|
| floor 0 trigger pulls (avg, careful) | 189.1 | 189.1 |
| floor 0 complete visits (of 8) | 3 | 3 |
| floor 0 energy drops per visit | 6.6 | 6.6 |
| PvP win rate (vanguard/juggernaut/skirmisher of 180) | 85/36/56 | 85/36/56 |

The fresh-save run being byte-identical is the claim, not a null result — `vanguard` keeps the
reference pool, `cell_up` is card-only so the drop stream never moved, and `BUFF_DROP_POOL` is
untouched.

## The third gap: prompts, not pixels

`enemyclaw` and `enemymaul` are still the only two entries in `WEAPON_DEFS` pointing at
another weapon's texture — the player spear's and hammer's. No image-generation tool was
available in this session, so on the owner's call the gap was closed as far as it can be
closed without one: two complete, copy-paste-ready GPT Image 2 prompts now live in
`art/weapon/prompts.md`.

The part that needed working out rather than writing down is what the prompts have to say that
none of the archived ones did. Every prompt in that file is for a PLAYER weapon, and they all
landed in the player palette — white-and-silver housing, warm gold crystal. Sampling
`gun_enemygun.png`'s actual pixels (the only enemy weapon with real art) gives the mob roster
its own: dark blue-grey housing `#202030`–`#404050`, **violet** crystal `#402080`/`#502090`/
`#7030B0`, pale-lilac highlights. At a ~40 px on-screen body the silhouette is barely legible
and colour is what actually says *this is theirs, not yours* — which is the real defect in
borrowing, since a claw that reads as player gear reads as **loot you could pick up**.

Both halves of the workflow are written down with it, including the two corrections a later
batch would otherwise repeat: `compress.mjs --long-axis=160`, not the 320 the archived section
still says (every weapon PNG went 320 → 160 on 2026-08-25 for the WeChat budget, and all 27
`scale` divisors moved with them), and re-measure `rotationOffsetRad` instead of keeping the
borrowed near-180° value, which belongs to art that will not be there any more.

## Still open

- **The PvE bot never swaps off the starter gun** (`weaponFireStats` reads `blaster` 100%),
  which is what leaves the `dry%` table above unable to measure an expensive frame running
  dry, and is the same instrument gap as v59's melee-share 0%. A bot that swaps under
  pressure is the one change that would make both rows real.
- **PvP win rates are skewed and it is not this pass's doing** — vanguard takes 47% of 180
  matches against a 33% fair share, identically before and after. The 2026-07-28 retune left
  it near fair share, so something between then and now moved it; unrelated to capacity, and
  it needs its own pass.
- **The two mob blades still borrow player art** — prompts written, generation pending.
- **`boss-core` still mounts no weapon module**, unchanged from v59.
