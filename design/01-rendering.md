# Rendering & depth architecture

Goal: a fixed tilted view (not pure top-down; slightly forward-leaning, like Soul Knight) that produces playable spatial relationships with 2D techniques.

## View

- **Tilted (3/4) view:** walls, pillars, and characters show a small "front face" instead of a pure top face, so height and volume read. This is the basis of the 3D feel.
- The camera has a fixed angle and never rotates; it may pan to follow the player.
- **Room zoom-to-cover** (legibility fix, 2026-08-02; cap raised 1.8→2.5 2026-08-12;
  contain-fit → cover-fit 2026-08-12, same day, follow-up; fit target changed from the
  whole floor to the CURRENT ROOM + cap 2.5→4.5 2026-08-17, see "Framing the current
  room" below): the fitted rect is scaled up so BOTH axes cover the viewport (cover-fit —
  zoom by whichever axis needs MORE zoom, capped at 4.5x so a tiny/degenerate room
  doesn't blow sprites into blocks) — `FxController.updateCamera`
  (`client/src/game/fx/FxController.ts`). Originally contain-fit (zoom by whichever axis
  is TIGHTER), which left a real dark `Backdrop`-filled void on the other axis whenever
  the room's aspect ratio didn't match the viewport's — raising the cap (2026-08-12,
  earlier that day) only shrank that void for a too-small room, it couldn't fix an
  aspect-ratio mismatch. Switched to cover-fit (2026-08-12, user's own pick between that
  and "keep the whole room visible, reposition the void") to close it for good: the
  room can now exceed the viewport on the axis that used to have void, and the camera
  pans/clamps to the player there, same as it already did for a big room/arena. A room
  that already covers the viewport at 1x on both axes is untouched (zoom floors at 1,
  never shrinks). See "Camera cover-fit + weapon-slot HUD chip" in `ROADMAP.md`.
  (`CommandBuilder` used to divide a screen-space mouse aim point by this same zoom
  before converting it to world space — moot since `10` v33 removed manual aim; the
  camera zoom itself is otherwise unaffected.)
- **Framing the current room** (2026-08-17, live report: *"镜头往下一些，尽量视口内只有当前
  房间，或者说给角色最好的展示"*). Two changes to the same function:
  - **The fit target is the player's current ROOM, not the whole floor.** A dungeon floor
    is co-resident — every room stitched into one world by `buildFloorGeometry` — so
    fitting `worldSize` meant fitting a ~2000 px floor into a 1920 px viewport, i.e.
    cover-fit resolved to zoom 1 and the player saw several rooms at once, each small.
    `GameLoop.cameraFrame` now looks the player's cached `roomId` up in
    `dungeonRoomRects`/`arenaRoomRects` and passes that rect as `updateCamera`'s `frame`;
    the whole floor stays the fallback for a mode with no room model. Level 1's rooms are
    ~480 px square, so this lands at ~4x and the room fills the viewport — which is what
    forced the `MAX_ZOOM` raise, since 2.5 bound in literally every room.
  - **The look-at point is biased above the player's feet** (`CAMERA_BODY_BIAS_R`, 8% of
    viewport height). Every entity reports its GROUND position, so a camera centred on it
    put the character's feet at screen centre and its whole body in the upper half, above
    a band of empty floor. Biasing the look-at point up in world space slides the rendered
    world DOWN and centres the character.
  - **Panning still clamps to the WORLD, not to `frame`.** Clamping to the room would hard-
    stop the camera at a doorway and cut off the corridor the player is walking into. The
    cost is that the room only fills the viewport exactly when the player is near its
    centre; standing off-centre shows a strip of the neighbouring room. A true one-room-
    per-screen lock would mean a jump-cut at every door, which is a separate design call.

## Coordinates & height model

Every entity has two Y values:

- **Ground coordinates `gx, gy`** — used for depth sorting, shadows, and collision.
- **Height `z`** — visual lift for flying bullets / elevated cosmetics (render only). Actors stay grounded (`z=0`) — there is no jump, and `z` never gates gameplay (`07`).

Render transform: `screen.x = gx`, `screen.y = gy - z`. A large part of the 3D feel comes from objects being able to leave the ground.

**Bullets are drawn leaving the barrel tip, not the sim's muzzle point** (2026-08-17, live
report: *"子弹要从枪口打出"*). The two are not the same place, and can't be: the engine puts
a bullet `muzzleOffset` along the aim ray **on the ground plane** and then lifts it by
`bulletZ`, while the rig rotates the gun **in screen space** at its socket bone's own
height — so aiming downward slides the sim's spawn point south across the floor while the
drawn barrel swings down the screen, leaving the two on visibly *parallel* lines (~16 world
px apart, and this camera zooms 4x). `RigSkin.muzzleLocal` reports the mounted module's
business end (socket-bone tip + a ray/rect measure of how far the texture reaches from its
anchor in its own baked direction), `Actor.muzzlePos` lifts that into world space, and
`Bullet.setMuzzleOrigin` eases the difference out over the first ~120 ms of flight. Fixed
on the VIEW, not by moving the sim's own muzzle: the sim position stays authoritative for
hit detection, and a longer sim muzzle would let a player standing flush against a wall
spawn shots on its far side. Null for anything with no rig-mounted module — every enemy,
whose placeholder barrel already ends within a pixel of its own sim muzzle.

## Depth sorting (Y-sort)

- The entity layer sets `sortableChildren = true`; each frame we set `entity.zIndex = entity.gy`.
- Lower on screen (larger gy) draws later → occludes objects above it. A character walking behind a pillar is hidden; in front, it hides the pillar.

## Shadows

- When lifted, a soft shadow is drawn at the **ground coordinates** (`shadow.gy = gy`, unaffected by z).
- The shadow shrinks, fades, and offsets slightly as `z` grows → reinforces the sense of height. This is the cheapest "3D cheat".

## Layers (bottom to top)

| Layer | Contents | Sorting |
|-------|----------|---------|
| ground | floor, ground decals | fixed |
| shadow | all cast shadows | fixed (below entities) |
| entities | characters / enemies / pillars / bullets | **Y-sort (zIndex = gy)** |
| fx | muzzle flashes, explosions, deflect flashes, per-element bullet trails (additive blend) | overlay |
| ui | HP, weapon, crosshair | topmost |

> The lighting layer (lightmap) is later inserted between entities and fx, composited with multiply blend. See the roadmap.

## Per-weapon local z-order

A weapon is attached to one of the character's orbiting weapon sockets (`02`/`13`) and rendered separately, and must switch front/back by facing:

- Facing up (dy < 0): weapon renders **behind** the body (weapon.zIndex = -1 inside the actor container).
- Facing down / sideways: weapon renders **in front** (weapon.zIndex = +1).
- The actor container itself has `sortableChildren = true`, with body.zIndex = 0.

Otherwise you get the "gun floating on the chest while facing away" artifact.

## Limits of fake 3D (honest note)

2D sorting is per-object, not per-pixel. The following cases break and must be avoided or accepted as approximations:

- One large sprite partially in front of and partially behind a tall object (crossing a thick pillar) → judged wholly front or back, artifact at the seam. Mitigation: split tall objects into segments, tune anchors carefully.
- Complex multi-layer occlusion → sorting rules must be refined.
- Continuous slopes / height transitions → approximation only.

For this game's scale (rooms, pillars, crates, enemies) these are largely avoidable. If true continuous 3D occlusion is needed → fall back to a Three.js orthographic camera (see the re-evaluation trigger in 00, Decision 1).

## Ambient animation rates (idle loops have a Nyquist floor)

Every idle loop in this layer is a sine driven by an accumulated `frameDt` clock in
**milliseconds** — `t += frameDt`, then `sin(t * k)`. The rate constant `k` is therefore in
**rad/ms**, and the frequency it produces is `k * 1000 / 2π` Hz. Getting this wrong by a
decimal place does not look like "a bit fast": once the per-frame phase step `k * 16.7`
approaches π, the loop crosses the display's Nyquist limit and **aliases**, so what renders
is a beat frequency between the animation and the refresh rate — jitter whose apparent speed
changes with the player's monitor, not the motion that was authored.

Keep every ambient loop in the band the scene already uses. Current inhabitants:

| Loop | Rate (rad/ms) | Frequency | Phase per 60fps frame |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Portal` alpha pulse | 0.003 | 0.48 Hz | 0.05 rad |
| `Pickup` hover + glow breathe | `2π/2000` | 0.50 Hz | 0.052 rad |
| `Actor` status aura | 0.008 | 1.27 Hz | 0.13 rad |
| *(Nyquist limit at 60fps)* | 0.188 | 30 Hz | π |

`Pickup`'s hover shipped at `0.12` (19.1 Hz, 2.0 rad/frame) and reached a player as "the
items on the ground flicker far too fast" — it had never been a bob at all. Two rules came
out of it:

- **Prefer a period constant to a rate constant.** `BOB_PERIOD_MS = 2000` with the rate
  derived from it states the intent in a unit a human can sanity-check; a bare `0.12` does
  not, which is how it survived review.
- **Give co-located instances different start phases.** Every pickup started at phase 0 and
  advanced identically, so a whole floor of loot rose and fell in unison and read as one
  synchronised flash rather than many objects. `Pickup` now offsets its start phase by the
  golden angle times its engine entity id — deterministic (no `Math.random`, per `06`), so
  two clients still draw the same drop identically.

Note that a bob is visible on more surfaces than the sprite: `z` also drives the shadow's
scale/alpha (see Shadows above), so a strobing height strobes the shadow too. `zIndex` is
the exception and must stay on **ground y** — routing it through screen y would make a
hovering object flicker in and out of the Y-sort against everything near it.

## Text measurement (Pixi's measure canvas is NOT its paint canvas)

Every piece of UI text in this project is a Pixi `Text` on a `fontFamily: 'monospace'`
style. Two independent canvases are involved in drawing one, and **they can resolve the
same font string to different fonts**:

- **Measuring** — `CanvasTextMetrics._canvas` prefers `new OffscreenCanvas(0, 0)` whenever
  the host has one, falling back to `DOMAdapter.get().createCanvas()` only if it doesn't.
- **Painting** — `CanvasTextGenerator` goes through `CanvasPool`, which always uses
  `DOMAdapter.get().createCanvas()` (a real `document.createElement('canvas')` in a browser).

Chrome does not resolve the CSS generic families (`monospace`, `sans-serif`, `serif`, …)
identically in those two contexts — an `OffscreenCanvas` has no document/CSS context to
read the user's configured fixed-width font from, so it falls back to a different family.
Measured on Windows Chrome 2026-08-15 with `bold 15px monospace`:

| string | DOM canvas (painted) | OffscreenCanvas (measured) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AAAAA` (Latin) | 41.2px | 45px |
| `ААААА` (Cyrillic) | 41.2px | 85px |

Both canvases are internally consistent (each *paints* what it *measures*, confirmed by
scanning `getImageData` alpha for the first and last non-empty column) — the defect is
purely that Pixi mixes the two. The visible result is a `Text` whose `width` is up to ~2x
its painted width: `anchor.set(0.5)` then centres the oversized measurement and the glyphs
land far left of where they belong. That is what produced the reported "Russian settings
labels sit outside their buttons" bug (`17-i18n.md`), and it silently affects anything else
sized or wrapped from Pixi's metrics.

**Fix:** `render/textMetrics.ts`'s `pinTextMeasurementToPaintCanvas()` overwrites the
statics Pixi memoises its measurement canvas into (`CanvasTextMetrics.__canvas` /
`__context`) with a `DOMAdapter`-created canvas, using Pixi's own `willReadFrequently`
context setting, and clears any font metrics already cached from the offscreen one. Going
through `DOMAdapter` rather than `document` directly is what keeps it correct on WeChat,
where the adapter is weapp-adapter's. Both entries (`main.ts`, `main.wechat.ts`) call it
before anything else, because the canvas is memoised on first use.

`ui/textWidth.ts`'s `estimateMonoWidth` is unaffected and still the right tool for *sizing*
a backing box (it needs no canvas at all, so it works under vitest); this is only about the
measurement Pixi does internally when it lays out and centres the glyphs themselves.

Covered by `render/textMetrics.test.ts`. Node has neither canvas kind, so the test fakes
both — with the real advances from the table above, so an unpinned Pixi picks the
"offscreen" fake exactly as it does in a browser and "pinned vs. not" is a real difference
rather than two names for the same stub. A side effect worth knowing: with a context pinned
this way, `Text.width` becomes computable under vitest at all, which is what lets those
tests assert on label-inside-box geometry that otherwise needs a browser.

**General lesson:** when text is *mis-centred* rather than merely mis-sized, and only in
one script, compare Pixi's measurement canvas against its paint canvas before suspecting
the app's own layout maths.

## Fidelity roadmap (by priority)

1. **[verified in demo]** Tilted view + Y-sort + height/shadow + additive-blend FX.
2. **[shipped 2026-08-03]** Dynamic lighting: a per-pixel fake normal derived at shader time from a sprite's own rendered luminance/alpha (a Sobel-style gradient over 4 neighbour-texel taps, the same trick milestone 5's `OutlineFilter` already uses for alpha-edge detection — no normal-map texture asset exists or is needed), shaded against a fixed key light (reusing `RoomBuilder.ts`'s "lit from upper-left" pillar-shading direction) plus a small dynamic point-light registry (`game/fx/lighting.ts`'s `LightRegistry` — the local player's own glow + transient muzzle-flash/impact bursts). This is a scoped equivalent of "normal maps + point lights + lightmap (multiply composite)," not that literal architecture: no `RenderTexture`/deferred-lighting layer exists anywhere in this codebase, and building one would be disproportionate to a fixed-camera 2D sim — a fifth custom `Filter` (`NormalLitFilter`, `game/fx/filters.ts`) does the job instead, following the same template as the four milestone-5 shaders below. Unblocked once ROADMAP 5.3 settled that GPT-Image-2-generated art counts as final production art (no more "normal-map authoring needs real art first" gate) — see ROADMAP's 2026-08-03 updates on both items for the full account.
3. **[shipped 2026-07-26]** Post-processing: bloom-lite (`BlurFilter` on the additive `fx` layer — a cheap approximation, not real multi-pass bloom), custom `VignetteFilter`/`ChromaticAberrationFilter` (`game/fx/filters.ts`, hand-written GLSL, no third-party filter package), hit-stop (brief sim-tick freeze, offline-only) + screen-shake (decaying trauma, `game/Game.ts`).
4. **[shipped 2026-07-26]** Particle system: `game/fx/Particles.ts` — muzzle flames + shell casings (on `bullet_fired`), explosion debris (on enemy `death`), ambient drifting dust. Graphics-only (no textures), same events-queue-driven render-only discipline as the rest of this doc.
5. **[shipped 2026-08-03] Custom shaders — all four items done:** dissolve on death,
   outline, energy shield, heat-haze distortion. All four are hand-written-GLSL custom
   Pixi `Filter`s in `game/fx/filters.ts`, applied to `Skin.view` only (not the whole
   actor container — weapon/aura/hp-bar/local-ring are separate children), composited
   together via `Actor.applySkinFilters()` when more than one is live at once (order:
   heat-haze warp, then shield glow, then outline highlight, then dissolve last). Shipped
   against today's placeholder art with no issues — the "read best against a real sprite
   silhouette, so this likely wants to follow milestone 2" sequencing preference recorded
   here earlier turned out not to matter in practice. Milestone 2 (lighting) has since
   shipped too (2026-08-03, see above) — the "genuinely blocked on real art" note that used
   to live here no longer applies, now that this project's GPT-Image-2 art counts as final.
   - **`EnergyShieldFilter`** — a shimmering rim-glow using the same UV-distance-from-
     centre technique as `VignetteFilter` (not true alpha-edge detection, so it needs no
     extra per-skin wiring against either the Graphics placeholder body or a real `.tao`
     rig). `Actor.setShield` drives `intensity` off the actor's live two-pool shield ratio
     (design/02/05/07) — full glow at a full shield, fading as it drains, gone once it
     hits 0 (the `shield_break` event's own flash, `EventReactor`, already covers that
     instant). Its UV-distance-from-0.5 assumption DOES need the render area itself to be
     centred and symmetric, though — Pixi's auto-computed filter bounds for `skin.view`
     are not (the placeholder's facing-direction wedge / a real rig's aim-mounted weapon
     sprite both extend outward on one side only), which read as a lopsided glow until
     fixed (2026-08-12): `Actor`'s constructor now pins an explicit, fixed `filterArea`
     on `skin.view`. X stays pinned to the actor's local origin (that asymmetry is
     genuinely facing-dependent). Y is a follow-up fix the same day: a real rig's
     decorative bones hang off the body bone's TIP, not its centre (`orbCoreRig.ts`), so
     the assembled silhouette is consistently top-heavy relative to local `(0,0)` in a
     way that does NOT depend on facing — pinning Y to a flat 0 (the first pass) still
     left the glow hugging the ground with the top of the sprite poking out above it.
     Fixed by measuring `skin.view.getLocalBounds()` once at a neutral rest pose and
     centring Y on that instead — ROADMAP's 2026-08-12 "Shield-centering follow-up" entry
     has the full account, including why the first fix's own test never caught this (it
     only ever exercised the Graphics placeholder, not a real loaded rig). A symmetric
     `filterArea` is necessary but was NOT sufficient — see the `vTextureCoord` gotcha
     below, which is what finally closed this bug out on 2026-08-15.
   - **`OutlineFilter`** — a REAL alpha-edge-detected silhouette outline (samples the
     actual rendered alpha at 4 neighbour texels via Pixi's auto-bound `uInputSize` filter
     uniform), unlike the shield's approximation — needed because an outline must hug
     whatever shape is actually drawn. `Actor.hitFlash()` fires it as a brief "you were
     just hit" flash, wired from `EventReactor`'s `hit` case via a new `Scene.actorAt(id)`
     lookup (added to `EventReactorHost` as a duck-typed `{ hitFlash(): void }`, so
     `EventReactor` still never imports scene/ types) — independent of the existing
     position-anchored `fx.flash()` burst, which reads as "impact happened here" rather
     than "this actor took it".
   - **`DissolveFilter`** — procedural cell noise (a GLSL hash of the UV, no noise
     texture — same "no textures" discipline as `Particles.ts`) burns away in patches as
     death progresses, ember-coloured edge trailing the boundary. Needed a real render-
     side architecture change, not just a new filter: `Scene.reconcile` used to destroy a
     dead entity's view the SAME tick it dropped out of the engine's `alive` list (the
     `seen`-diff cleanup loop). Now, when the vanished view is an `Actor` (not a bullet/
     pickup — those still destroy immediately), `Scene` calls `Actor.startDissolve()`
     (hides weapon/aura/hp-bar/local-ring, leaving only the dissolving body) and keeps it
     in a separate `dying: Actor[]` list, stepped every `Scene.interpolate()` call until
     `Actor.isDissolved` reports the ~700ms animation done, then destroys it for real.
   - **`HeatHazeFilter`** — a cheap sine-based UV wobble (no noise texture, no real
     refraction pass — same "own the code, own the cost" simplification as the vignette).
     Driven by `Actor.setStatus`'s existing `burnTicks > 0` condition (the same signal
     that already drives the burn ring in `AURAS`) — a burning actor's silhouette itself
     shimmers, on top of the ring.
   - **Gotcha hit while building `OutlineFilter`:** redeclaring Pixi's auto-bound
     `uInputSize` filter uniform in a fragment shader without an explicit `highp`
     qualifier fails to link on GL ("Precisions of uniform 'uInputSize' differ between
     VERTEX and FRAGMENT shaders") — the default vertex shader (`defaultFilterVert`)
     implicitly gets `highp` (GLSL ES vertex-stage default for `float`), while a fragment
     shader has no default and Pixi's own precision header pins it to `mediump`. Any
     future filter that reads `uInputSize` (or another Pixi-auto-bound uniform) in its
     fragment stage needs `uniform highp vec4 uInputSize;`, not a bare `uniform vec4`.
   - **`vTextureCoord` is NOT 0..1 — the `FRAME_UV` gotcha (root-caused 2026-08-15, the
     real end of the "lopsided shield ring" saga).** Pixi's default filter vertex shader
     emits `vTextureCoord = aPosition * (uOutputFrame.zw * uInputSize.zw)`, so it spans
     `0 .. (filtered region / allocated texture)`. Those two differ almost always: filter
     inputs come from `TexturePool.getOptimalTexture`, which rounds each dimension up to
     the next power of two, so a 130px-wide region is handed a 256px-wide texture and
     `vTextureCoord.x` never exceeds 0.508. Any shader that treats `0.5` as "the middle"
     is therefore centred on the POOL TEXTURE, not on the sprite — and since a region's
     pixel size is `filterArea × camera zoom × renderer resolution`, crossing a pow2
     boundary flips the effect from correctly centred to entirely off-region with no code
     change. That is what produced the long-reported partial/crescent shield ring, and
     what made it look like "integer camera zoom is fine, 1.5/1.32 is broken" — which got
     misdiagnosed (commit `d5c06db`, since reverted) as Pixi corrupting filters under a
     non-integer ancestor scale, and "fixed" by baking `layers.entities` to a 1:1
     `RenderTexture` every frame. That workaround left the ring still off-centre and cost
     real resolution: the bake texture defaulted to `resolution: 1` with no antialias
     while the renderer runs at `min(devicePixelRatio, 2)`, so every actor/bullet/pillar
     was sampled at roughly `1/(2 × zoom)` of the rest of the frame, and additive children
     (status auras, bullets) lost their blend against the ground. Real fix: the shared
     `FRAME_UV` GLSL prelude in `fx/filters.ts` — `frameUv()` remaps `vTextureCoord` to a
     true 0..1 across the region, `frameOffset()` converts a region-space displacement
     back to texcoord space, `clampToFrame()` keeps displaced samples off the pooled
     texture's stale neighbouring pixels. Used by the shield (ring centre), vignette and
     chromatic aberration (screen centre), dissolve (cell grid), and heat haze (wobble
     frequency + amplitude). `OutlineFilter`/`NormalLitFilter` deliberately do NOT use it:
     they only ever step by one texel, and `uInputSize.zw` is already exactly that.
     `EnergyShieldFilter` additionally sets `clipToViewport: false`, because Pixi otherwise
     intersects the region with the viewport (`FilterSystem._calculateFilterBounds`) and
     would re-introduce a lopsided ring for any shielded actor standing at a screen edge;
     that is safe only because `filterArea` already bounds it to a small fixed square, and
     is deliberately NOT done for the two screen-wide post-fx, which need the clip to size
     themselves to the viewport. General lesson: when a filter's symptom flips on and off
     with the camera zoom, suspect the pow2 filter-texture pool before suspecting Pixi.
