"""Produce the four cues a CHARACTER makes about itself: swing, hurt, death.player, spawn.

The counterpart to `process_all.py` (the cues an engine EVENT makes at a world position) and
`process_ui.py` (the cues a SCREEN makes). These four are the audio half of the rig's own six
authored clips -- `attack`, `hurt`, `death`, `spawn` all animate a body since 2026-09-02 and
none of them made a sound. `idle`/`move` are the two that never should.

It imports `process_all`'s measurement and encoding helpers unchanged -- mono, trim, cap,
bandwidth-driven rate search, smallest-MP3 encode -- and differs in exactly two steps, which
is why it is a fourth driver rather than more rows in the first one:

**1. Where the peak-match reference comes from.** `process_all.py` reads `synth.json`, an
audit of RE-RENDERED synth voices, because those voices stack several primitives and their
delivered peak cannot be read off the table. That file is a scratch artefact and is not in
the repo, which makes that driver un-re-runnable as written. Every voice added for these four
cues is a SINGLE `tone()`, whose gain envelope ramps 0 -> `gain` -> 0 over a unit-amplitude
oscillator, so its peak IS its `gain` argument exactly -- the same closed form `process_ui.py`
relies on, chosen deliberately here rather than merely inherited. The reference moves only
when `platform/audioSynth.ts` moves, and nothing has to survive between sessions.

**2. A source can be a REGION of a longer take.** `swing` is the one cue in the game with no
material in the six Kenney packs -- there is no whoosh, swoosh or air family in any of their
323 files, so it comes from BigSoundBank (`fetch_bigsoundbank.py`). The finding that decided
this table: the useful sword whooshes are not the 1-second files, they are the ELEVEN discrete
swings inside `whoosh_s0572.ogg`, an 11 s mono take. Measured across all eleven, they are far
more homogeneous than any four separate files could be (centroid 1433-1806 Hz, -40 dB extent
124-153 ms), which is exactly what a variant SET wants: four takes of one action, not four
different actions. The regions below are written as measured times rather than found by an
onset detector, because a detector in a shipping driver is a second thing that can drift; the
source file's sha256 in `credits.json` is what makes the times stay meaningful.

**Direction of imitation, as in the UI pass: the SAMPLE was picked first.** None of these four
cues had a synth voice before this pass, so the file was chosen on `audit.py`'s gates plus the
measurements recorded per cue below, and the voice in `platform/audioSynth.ts` was then written
to imitate its duration and centroid. "Closest match to the incumbent" is not the rationale for
any of these files and should not be read into them.

    # The first cut chose body impacts (impactPunch_heavy) on the reasoning that a punch is
    # what "you took it" sounds like, and picked among them by SPECTRAL CENTROID. Both were

    # a phone speaker can actually reproduce -- and take its RMS. The shipped `impact` set
    # delivers -38.7 to -39.7 dBFS there. The punches deliver **-48 to -57**, because 96-98% of
    # their energy sits below 300 Hz. On the WeChat target the game's single most important
    # feedback cue would have been inaudible while the cue it layers under was not. Centroid

#   death.player 0.20  the loudest single voice in the table, and the only cue besides `win`
#                      that ends a run. Still under `win`'s stacked chord.
#   spawn        0.12  level with `muzzle`. It can arrive nine at a time.
