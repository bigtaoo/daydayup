"""Produce the shipped music loops from AI-generated masters (design/11 "Music & ambience").

The third driver beside `process_all.py` (combat SFX) and `process_ui.py` (screen cues).
It is separate because all three of its inputs differ from a cue's, and each difference
changes a step rather than a parameter:

  * The input is a 4-6 minute SONG, not a cue. A loop REGION has to be chosen, and its two
    endpoints have to match each other across the player's crossfade window -- so the
    region is an authored decision recorded in TRACKS below, measured by `music_probe`-style
    band analysis rather than eyeballed.
  * The input is mastered to 0 dBFS; the shipped cue set was deliberately peak-matched DOWN
    to the synth voices it replaced and lives at -14..-21 dBFS. There is no synth voice for
    music to match, so level is set by a BAND TARGET: the 250-2000 Hz RMS, which is the band
    `impact`, `muzzle` and `ui.tap` all peak in. Both masters measured ~20 dB hot.
  * It is stereo and it STAYS stereo. `audit.py`'s sfx/ui gates forbid stereo ("wastes
    bytes") because a 100 ms cue's second channel is pure overhead; a 76 s bed streams, so
    the bytes amortise and the RAM argument for mono does not apply at all.

One property worth stating because it is not obvious: every filter here runs as a single
zero-phase multiply over the WHOLE region's spectrum. That is circular convolution, and a
loop region IS circular -- so filtering cannot introduce the endpoint discontinuity that a
windowed/overlap-add filter would.

    The first version of this search scored a candidate from four 4096-point frames spaced
    0.5 s apart -- 16 k of the 96 k samples in a 2 s crossfade window. It ranked a menu
    region at 3.01 dB that `xfade_band_diff` then measured at 5.61 dB on the extracted
    audio. Sampling a window is not measuring it, and a search whose ranking metric is
    coarser than its acceptance metric will hand back candidates that do not survive.

    So both now go through `band_profile` over the full window AND through `profile_diff`
    for the comparison -- the same two calls the gate makes, not a reimplementation. The
    second time this drifted, the search was averaging band differences unweighted while
    the gate weighted them by energy, and a region ranked 2.44 dB measured 3.39 dB.

    It also searches the PROCESSED signal, which is the third form the same drift took. The
    shelf is what forced it: `boss` is a sub-dominated drone, so attenuating below 80 Hz
    moves the energy weighting onto the mids, where its head and tail differ more. A region
    ranked 1.41 dB on the raw audio measured 3.69 dB after the shelf that always applies to
    it. Level normalisation is a scalar and cannot change a dB difference, and the 24 kHz
    resample only drops bands near -80 dBFS, so the shelf is the one step that matters here.

    Cost adds small terms for level mismatch and for settling in a passage quieter than the
